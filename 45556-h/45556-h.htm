<p class="pn center large">THE PUNCHINELLOS</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="pn center slarge"><span class="smcap">Pappina Pierno</span></p>

<p class="pn p2">It was away up in that part of Naples called
San Lucia, where clothes seem forever hanging out
to dry, that Pappina lived with the rest of the
Pierno family, a tribe too large to enumerate.</p>

<p>Pappina was only seven years of age, but she
was different from every other child living in
dingy, dirty San Lucia. Few even of the grown
people of the neighborhood cared to be clean, and
as for their hair&mdash;why, they paid no attention to
that, but let it go as it found itself. But Pappina
took delight in combing her silky black hair and in
washing her beautiful face and dimpled hands.</p>

<p>This was a wonder to all who lived near.</p>

<p>"The one who washes! <i>Per bacco</i> [Great
heavens]!" they said when they saw her. But
their amazement did not disturb Pappina. She
went about her play in the sordid old tenement&ndash;court
like a sunbeam astray.</p><br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Doing the family washing in Italy</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Only when she sang and danced and the people
gathered around her did she seem to take much
notice of her neighbors.</p>

<p>"Such a voice in one so small! It is from the
angels!" the women would say, as, charmed by her
singing and her grace, they would toss her <i>un soldo</i>
(a half&ndash;penny).</p>

<p>The other children would run with every <i>soldo</i>
to buy macaroni, for the children were always
hungry in San Lucia, where even <i>soldi</i> are scarce;
but Pappina, a true little Neapolitan, loved dress
and display. She spent her money for trinkets
with which to adorn her bewitching, graceful self.</p>

<p>Pappina's love of beauty sprang from her eager
little heart like a sweet flower from a patch of rich
earth on a rocky hillside.</p>

<p>It grew with very little nourishment from without,
for in all her seven years she had hardly been
out of sight of the hivelike tenement where her
hard&ndash;working father himself had been born. On
rare days she was taken to a near&ndash;by street where
for generations the women of the neighborhood had
gone to do their family washing at a free fountain;
and of course, as all little girls in Italy do, she went
to a gray old church regularly with her mother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Down the narrow
street, past the
mean shops, to
church was the
longest journey
out into the world
the bright&ndash;eyed
little maiden had
ever taken.</p>

<p>Her brothers,
however, were
great travelers.
Sometimes at
night they came
home with tales
of the wonderful
foreigners who
thronged the Toledo,
of the splendid
shops where all the
treasures of the
earth were gathered&mdash;jewels
that
sparkled like the
sun; flowers that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
smelled like a breath of heaven; rich and gay
clothes! Pappina sat with shining eyes and listened
to these amazing tales until her heart was
full of a longing to go and see for herself the wonders
described.</p>

<p>On some mornings after drinking in news of the
unknown world to which her brothers journeyed
every day, Pappina would follow them down the
stairs, through the court, out upon the cobble&ndash;stoned
street, with outstretched hands, crying:</p>

<p>"Take me, Filippo, Vittorio!"</p>

<p>"<i>Non oggi, sorella</i> [Not to&ndash;day, sister]," they
laughed as they dodged between the people in the
street.</p>

<p>Sometimes she would follow her brothers for
some distance, only to be taken back into the courtyard
of the tenement when they discovered her
running after them. Pappina, who had a temper
of her own, returned more often in anger than in
tears.</p>

<p>One day a great resolve came to her as she stood
watching them go away.</p>

<p>"I've staved at home long enough," she said to
herself. "They won't take me, but I'm going;
I'm surely going."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>Pappina spent all the morning in adorning herself
for the journey. Time and again her mother
called to her:</p>

<p>"Pappina, <i>bambina</i> [baby], what are you
doing?"</p>

<p>But Pappina, standing before a bit of looking&ndash;glass,
never heard the call, she was so busy pinning
on a bit of lace or a ribbon, or combing and curling
her tresses.</p>

<p>Soon after noon a grotesque little figure darted
out of the tenement and down the street. Without
looking to right or left it ran swiftly for a short distance,
and then it stopped and looked back to see
if any one were following. Then Pappina&mdash;for it
was she&mdash;moved on, bound for the Toledo.</p>

<p>She held her head up proudly, and all the bits
of lace and ribbon that she had fastened to her
faded little frock fluttered about her as she hurried
on&mdash;toward the Toledo she thought, but, in truth,
over the bridge that leads to the Marina or wharf
at Castle dell'Ovo.</p>

<p>The place had no historic interest for her.
Pappina knew nothing of history; she was just a
poor little Neapolitan girl. Only foreign tourists
visited the oval&ndash;shaped castle because it was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
place where Cicero met Brutus bloody&ndash;handed
from the murder of Cæsar; where kings and
queens had dwelt and been imprisoned. She saw
only the crowds of people&mdash;the divine people who
made the wonderland her brothers told about.</p>

<p>Some of the people were waving their arms
toward the water and laughing. Pappina approached
the edge of the wharf, that she might see
everything that was going on.</p>

<p>Well&ndash;dressed men were throwing money into
the waves.</p>

<p>"What wealth they must have!" exclaimed
Pappina to herself. "Such queer words they speak,
too! These must be the foreigners Vittorio
tells about!"</p>

<p>She drew still nearer and saw that the people
were laughing at the way a mob of half&ndash;naked
boys were diving for the <i>soldi</i> the foreigners threw
into the water, bringing the coins up in their
mouths.</p>

<p>"Oh, the foreigners are not crazy; they are
only kind," she thought.</p>

<p>She turned at a burst of laughter behind her,
and there were more foreigners throwing <i>soldi</i> to
more boys who were standing on their heads, turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
hand&ndash;springs, and  crying: "<i>Date</i> [give] <i>un
soldo</i>."</p>

<p>Pappina was astonished. There were blond&ndash;haired
Englishmen, blue&ndash;eyed Germans, black&ndash;whiskered
Russians, generous Americans; and such
wonderful ladies everywhere!</p>

<p>"Where do all the <i>soldi</i> come from?" she
murmured as she stood gazing about her in
amazement.</p>

<p>Suddenly a group of light&ndash;hearted tourists, bent
on discovering all the treasures of a foreign land,
swept around Pappina.</p>

<p>"What a quaint little beauty!" one lady
exclaimed. "See how she has decked herself out
in all her finery! What cherubic eyes!"</p>

<p>Pappina clasped her hands to her breast and
shrank back from the gaze of the eyes fastened
upon her. She was such a little girl, and never
before had she been so far away from home; no
wonder the sudden attention of all these finely
dressed ladies and gentlemen frightened her.</p>

<p>"I must go home," she exclaimed; "I must
run home and tell them all about it. Oh, what a
grand time I've had!" She laughed aloud as she
broke through the crowd and darted away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>On ran Pappina until she spied the statues of
La Villa, and then, although the beauty of the
park was before her eyes, she was frightened.
Where was her home&mdash;her dear, dear home? where
were her brothers and sisters? Pappina was lost.</p>

<p>Suddenly her lips stopped quivering: forgotten
were her home and her fright. Her little feet
paused.</p>

<p>A band! Wonder of wonders! For the first
time in her life Pappina heard the whole air
aquiver. Streams of sweet sound swept around
her. Her whole body tingled, down to her feet.
She began to dance with the unconsciousness of
a music&ndash;mad little child. Tapping her toes on the
pavement, gliding and swaying to and fro with the
music, keeping time with her arms, dancing with
truly wonderful grace, she had drawn a large group
of people about her by the time the waltz had
ceased.</p>

<p>"Bravo! Bravo!" the people cried as they
showered <i>soldi</i> upon the surprised little girl.</p>

<p>She drew back, frightened.</p>

<p>"Yours, all yours!" called some voices.</p>

<p>She began picking up the coins as she laughed
her thanks. Her chubby little hands were soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
so full that she dropped some <i>soldi</i> every time she
picked up one. She gave a perplexed sigh, then
suddenly made a purse of her apron and filled it
with the jingling
money. How the
people laughed at
her cleverness!</p>

<p>Rich little Pappina!
The luxuries
of the world&mdash;her
world&mdash;were
now within her
reach. What
should she buy?
For a moment her
bright eyes rested
on the strings of
macaroni some
boys near her were eating. She felt a sudden
hunger, but she had wanted a coral necklace too
long to spend her money for the mere pleasure of
eating, so she started off to hunt for a shop filled
with jewels such as Filippo had often told about.</p><br />

<p class="p1">Pappina had not gone a hundred feet when she
spied Filippo himself, sitting with a group of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
twinkling&ndash;eyed, barefooted boys of his age, playing
"Mora," the Italians' favorite game of chance.
The boys&mdash;shouting, disputing, quarreling, eager
to win&mdash;were all so intent on the game that not
one of them noticed Pappina's approach. Slipping
up behind her brother, she clasped one hand over
his eyes, asking: "<i>Chi e</i> [Who is it]?" and
laughing merrily when she saw his surprise.</p>

<p>Filippo turned sharply toward her and gruffly
demanded: "What are you doing here?" In
her joy she ignored both his anger and his question.
With dancing eyes she jingled her coins.</p>

<p>"See," she cried, "I've been dancing. Come
quickly, Filippo; I want a coral necklace; take
me where I can buy one."</p>

<p>"Sit down, you simpleton," he growled.</p>

<p>Words proved useless. Pappina must wait,
so she sat down close beside Filippo, watching the
game patiently for some time. Tired of this, she
opened her apron, trying to count her wealth.</p>

<p>Luck certainly was against Filippo. His day's
profits from the sale of cigarettes were slowly but
surely dwindling away. To lose his earnings
usually meant to remain away from home all night,
for to return without money brought worse hardships<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
than sleeping supperless on the street. Alas,
to&ndash;day there was no way out of it! He must make
good his losses. Great beads of perspiration
stood on his brow as he recklessly risked his last
<i>soldo</i>. Lost! Muttering an oath, he turned toward
Pappina, who still sat at his elbow absorbed
in her efforts to count her <i>soldi</i>.</p><br />

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Playing mora</p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1">At another time Filippo would have laughed
at his favorite sister as she counted softly to herself,
"One, two, six, four," but to&ndash;day he heard
nothing, saw nothing but her tempting <i>soldi</i>. He
reached into her apron for funds with which to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
make another play. Pappina looked up, surprised,
but said nothing.</p>

<p>The second time she jumped quickly to her
feet, her eyes and cheeks aflame. The third time
she gave him a vigorous slap.</p>

<p>"Let my money alone! You're a mean,
horrid boy!"</p>

<p>The boys laughed loudly, then took up the
game, shouting as before, "<i>Uno</i>, <i>quattro</i>, <i>tre</i>
[One, four, three]," etc. So boisterous were
they that Pappina began to cry. The necklace
was forgotten.</p>

<p>"I'm so hungry, Filippo, and I'm tired, too.
Take me home." He made no move. "Don't
you hear me? I want to go home at once, Filippo,"
and she stamped her little foot imperiously.</p>

<p>The game thus interrupted, the boys arose
and moved on.</p>

<p>Filippo shook Pappina as he demanded: "What
business have you down here bothering me. I'd
like to know! You'd better stay home after this."</p>

<p>Pappina paid no attention to his anger.</p>

<p>"Oh, Filippo," she cried, "it's lots of fun to
come down here to the Toledo. I'm coming
every day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Tain't the Toledo," said Filippo, still out
of sorts.</p>

<p>"'Tis, too! I know it is, for I saw all the fine
people in carriages. Didn't the foreigners throw
<i>soldi</i> at me?"</p>

<p>"Don't try to tell me. I tell you, 'tain't
the Toledo."</p>

<p>"Then take me there," pleaded Pappina,
"I won't go home till&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped at a burst of applause.</p>

<p>"What is it, Filippo?" she asked, eyeing a
crowd of people they had reached.</p>

<p>"Come along; it's only the Punchinellos."</p>

<p>"The Punchinellos? What's that?"</p>

<p>"Were you born yesterday? Live in Naples
and don't know the Punchinellos?"</p>

<p>Filippo stopped to laugh at so absurd an idea,
for Punchinellos are as common in Italy as hand&ndash;organs
in America.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of his laughter, Pappina
pulled Filippo into the crowd.</p>

<p>"Filippo, I cannot see," she cried.</p>

<p>She could hear voices carrying on a conversation,
but as for seeing, she was lost in a wilderness
of legs. Dragging her unwilling brother by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the arm, elbowing her way through the crowd,
she took her place directly in front of the
Punchinellos.</p>

<p>The first part of the puppet performance was
just ended. Then came the most popular of all
puppet plays, in which a splendid puppet fully
ten inches high, with fixed, staring expression,
began good&ndash;naturedly to deceive the smaller
puppets.</p>

<p>As the first simple&ndash;minded puppet gave his
wealth to the arch deceiver, Pappina cried out:</p>

<p>"Don't give it to him! Don't, I say! He is
bad."</p>

<p>The crowd roared. Filippo pinched her.</p>

<p>"Shut up, you baby!" he whispered. "They're
only puppets."</p>

<p>Pappina turned her flashing eyes for a moment
toward Filippo, who expected his saucy sister to
give his hair a vigorous pull, but she was too
interested in the play to stop now even for this
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Several times Filippo had to hold her by the
arm, to prevent her from running to the rescue
of the abused puppets. He was ashamed of her
ignorance. He wanted her to go home, but she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
refused to move, and he knew her willfulness too
well to insist.</p>

<p>The play continued. A puppet who refused
to give up his money was beaten on the back
till dead.</p>

<p>"Stop him! Stop him!" screamed Pappina
in her excitement.</p>

<p>Filippo placed his hand over Pappina's mouth.</p>

<p>"Let her alone!" cried several persons in the
crowd, so he stopped trying to repress her and
joined in the merriment over her enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The play ends with the murder of the villain,
an event which never fails to bring forth the
laughter and applause of the audience, with shouts
of "Hurrah! Hurrah!" This time, however, the
crowd failed to show its approval in a more
substantial way.</p>

<p>The hat was passed. Nothing was given.</p>

<p>The owner of the Punchinellos stood expectantly
awaiting the returns. Timidly the pale
woman took him the empty hat. He scowled.
Turning toward the dispersing crowd, he cried:</p>

<p>"What! You give me no money? Sons of
dogs, I play no more to you"&mdash;this being a rebuke
all Punchinello owners use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>No one seemed to care except Pappina and
the woman. The latter shrank back from the
showman's wrath.</p>

<p>The rowdies and hoodlums, observing his disappointment,
remained. They were waiting to be
called "figure of a pig," which to an Italian
is a deadly insult and means trouble. They were
hoping, longing for a fight, and it would have
come but for Pappina.</p>

<p>She saw the brown&ndash;haired woman trembling
at the rage of the disappointed man, and down
she dug into her apron and passed a handful of
<i>soldi</i> to the poor creature, who smiled her thanks.</p>

<p>Pappina sealed her fate by this act of generosity,
for her beauty and grace attracted the
swarthy Punchinello man's notice.</p>

<p>As Filippo led Pappina away, the owner of the
puppet show muttered something to the pale&ndash;faced
woman who had passed the hat, and thrusting
the little stage toward her, darted off after the
homeward&ndash;bound children.</p>

<p>Down the street they went, hunter and hunted,
through the crowds, up highways and down
byways, to the humble home in San Lucia.</p>

<p>"I have brought home the little runaway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
She was&mdash;" A knock at the door interrupted
Filippo's speech.</p>

<p>All the Pierno family were within the poor
home. They looked at one another and grew
still. Pietro, the father, went to the door and
opened it.</p>

<p>"It's the Punchinello man!" exclaimed Filippo.</p>

<p>"I am Guiseppe Capasso, signor," said the
dark&ndash;browed man, bowing and stepping inside the
doorway, "and if you are the father of yonder
little girl I have business with you."</p>

<p>The children whispered together and drew
away from Pappina, who ran to her mother.</p>

<p>Guiseppe Capasso began at once to bargain
for the little girl.</p>

<p>In spite of his poverty and his desire for money,
Pietro was loath to part with his child. He sat
with bowed head, looking neither to right nor
to left, apparently uninterested.</p>

<p>Guiseppe leaned forward and touched Pietro on
the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Come, come," he said, "can you keep so
beautiful a child a prisoner in this dingy San
Lucia when&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Vieni, bambina</i> [come, baby]," Pietro interrupted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
him, holding out his arms to Pappina.
She ran to him and climbed upon his knee.</p>

<p>"<i>Si</i> [yes], signor," Pietro began, as he took one
of Pappina's curls in his hand, "<i>bella</i>, <i>bella</i>
[Beautiful, beautiful], but she has a temper of
her own at times. She ain't always sweet and
gentle as she looks; are you, <i>bambina?</i> You,
signor, don't know her or her ways. She ain't
like any of the others. We love her best of all.
No, signor, we can't give up Pappina." He
looked at the child with love and pride.</p>

<p>Then Guiseppe with his glib tongue started all
over again. He was ready with many arguments
why it would be best for Pietro to hire Pappina
to him.</p>

<p>"I will be good to her and educate her. Marta,
my wife, and I will take her traveling over Italy
like the daughter of a lord."</p>

<p>Still Pietro shook his head.</p>

<p>"Such advantages&mdash;can you refuse them?
And the money&mdash;" Guiseppe leaned toward
Pietro, slyly watching him as he repeated slowly,
"and&mdash;the&mdash;money&mdash;".</p>

<p>Pietro raised his head a trifle, looking into the
cunning eyes of the other man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Think how much it will do to feed and clothe
the others," Guiseppe urged. "I pay you money
for the right to give your child splendid advantages.
<i>Per bacco!</i> What more do you ask?"</p>

<p>Pietro began to waver, and Guiseppe, seeing
this, continued his arguments.</p>

<p>It was a case of a shrewd man bargaining with a
poor, ignorant one. Guiseppe&mdash;smiling, shrugging
his shoulders&mdash;met every objection, and at last
Pietro consented to let him take Pappina for a year.</p>

<p>"Well, get the child ready," said Guiseppe,
changing his tone from coaxing to command as
soon as the bargain was closed and the money paid.</p>

<p>"But I don't want to go," Pappina cried,
running to her mother in whose apron she fairly
buried her frightened little self.</p>

<p>"<i>Su, su</i> [Come, come]!" exclaimed Guiseppe.
"There's many would be glad of your chance."</p>

<p>"Oh, signor," said Elisa, throwing her arm
about her child, "let us have her one night more!
She is tired. One night more! I will send her
to you with Filippo in the morning."</p>

<p>Guiseppe shook his head.</p>

<p>"The bargain's closed. Quick, get her clothes,
we must be off."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>"She is ready as she stands," said Pietro,
pointing to Pappina, who stood holding tightly
to her mother.</p>

<p>"What, no clothes!"  cried Guiseppe harshly.</p>

<p>Elisa looked angrily at him.</p>

<p>Guiseppe, anxious to get away, went to Pappina
and rested his hand on her head with a show of
tenderness.</p>

<p>"Come, little one, come," he said, "and to&ndash;morrow
you shall buy a splendid dress, bright and
new."</p>

<p>Pappina was interested.</p>

<p>"Will you take me to the Toledo, where all
the lords and ladies are?" she asked.</p>

<p>"<i>Si, si, carina</i> [yes, yes, little dear]," said
Guiseppe guilefully.</p>

<p>"Go with him, <i>bambina</i>. It is best," said
Pietro, trying to disguise his fears and hide his
sorrow.</p>

<p>Pappina, taught always to obey her parents,
hesitated no longer.</p>

<p>"I'm ready," she said, leaving her mother's
side.</p>

<p>There were no preparations to make for the
child's departure, no clothes to fold and pack.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
All she owned she was wearing. She had only to
bid adieu to the loved ones before starting out
with Guiseppe Capasso into the street, into a
new life.</p>

<p>Elisa, wringing her hands and with tears raining
down her cheeks, watched her most beautiful
child disappear into the dusk. Her grief would
have been wilder still had she known the truth&mdash;for
Pappina was leaving San Lucia forever.</p>

<p class="pp">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="pn center slarge"><span class="smcap">The Conquest of Guiseppe</span></p>


<p class="pn p2">When Pappina awoke the next morning, the
little east room where she lay was flooded with
sunshine. She looked about her wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Where am I? Is this a dream?" she asked
herself softly.</p>

<p>For a few moments she lay with half&ndash;closed,
sleepy eyes looking in the golden light at the
white curtains draped at the window.</p>

<p>"Pretty, pretty," she murmured. Her little
hand took up the coverlet. It was white! She
turned over quickly: there was a white covering
on her pillow! Surely this was not home! She
sat up, rubbing her eyes, and there was brown&ndash;haired
Marta smiling at her from the other side of
the room.</p>

<p>Marta was an Englishwoman. While traveling
through Italy as maid to the Countess Filota, she
had met and fallen in love with the handsome
professional story&ndash;teller, Guiseppe Capasso. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
their marriage he had turned his stock of stories
to account by setting up as a puppet showman.</p>

<p>Marta knew how to take care of a child. Her
English face shone with pleasure as she washed
Pappina, combed her hair, and dressed her, clean
and rested, for breakfast.</p>

<p>This home was poor. The furnishings were
little better than those of Pappina's own, but it
was clean. Pappina looked about the room.</p>

<p>"I like it," she said.</p>

<p>She had just finished the simple breakfast
Marta served when Guiseppe appeared, frowning,
in the doorway.</p>

<p>The gladness went out of Marta's eyes as though
a cloud had passed before the sun.</p>

<p>Pappina noticed his scowl and was half frightened
for a moment. She clung close to Marta,
waiting for Guiseppe to speak.</p>

<p>From under his heavy, shaggy eyebrows he
stood silently studying the face of the black&ndash;eyed
child. Pappina flushed under his scrutiny. She
wanted to cry, but she was not lacking in spirit
and she did not mean to let him know that he
frightened her.</p>

<p>"Signor, why don't you say good&ndash;morning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
Pappina?" she asked. "I shan't like you if you
look so cross."</p>

<p>Guiseppe was surprised at the speech and
pleased at her courage. Most children ran away
from him when he scowled and looked fiercely at
them, as he knew he had looked at Pappina.
To Maria's astonishment he burst into a hearty
laugh.</p>

<p>"I'm good and I'm cross, <i>bambina</i>. I'm
clouds and I'm sunshine. Sometimes I'll be kind.
Sometimes, maybe, I'll beat you."</p>

<p>"No, you won't," retorted Pappina, darting
from Marta's side. "Oh, no, signor! If you
should dare, I'd run away from you."</p>

<p>Guiseppe believed her when he saw her small
clenched fists and the fire of indignation in her
eyes. He knew she meant what she said.</p>

<p>"<i>Hola</i>, the sauce box! I'll break her in!
I'll curb her spirit by degrees," he told himself,
smiling as though he enjoyed the prospect. Bowing
with great courtliness, he said aloud: "Ah,
a very beautiful morning to you, Madamigella
Pappina."</p>

<p>Pappina stood still a moment, watching him;
then, with a shrug of her shoulders, she replied</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Ebbene</i> [Well]! But you have not told me,
signor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Call me, Guiseppe," the man interrupted.
"We're just old Guiseppe and Marta to every one."</p>

<p>"Well, then, old Guiseppe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Guiseppe, without the old, if you please,
signorina." He bowed mockingly, but he smiled
as though the child's independence and fearlessness
had charmed his surliness away.</p>

<p>"Signor Guiseppe, you have not told me at
what time you will take me to the Toledo. I want
the new dress you promised to buy me to&ndash;day."</p>

<p>Marta held her breath. Would Guiseppe, who
had led her such a hard life for years, permit this
child to look boldly into his face and command
him to do her bidding? Would he suddenly burst
into a rage and rain blows upon her?</p>

<p>To her relief she saw a half&ndash;concealed smile
on his lips as he took from his pocket a handful
of money. He counted out a few pieces and laid
them on the table.</p>

<p>"Marta, buy the minx stuff for a dress&mdash;and
shoes, too, I suppose. We can't have her toes
sticking out as they are now," he said.</p>

<p>"And stockings?" asked Marta with a courage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
she could never have summoned had she been
asking for money for herself.</p>

<p>"She'll do without them," Guiseppe replied
grimly. "If her feet are covered she'll get along.
I'll go alone with the Punchinellos this morning.
This afternoon I'll keep my promise and take the
child to the Toledo, although why she's so crazy
to go there is more than I know."</p>

<p>Taking up his Punchinello box, he left the
room.</p>

<p>Pappina danced about, radiantly happy over
the prospect of a new frock.</p>

<p>"You'll let me go with you, won't you, Marta?
I want so to go, and if there's money enough.
Marta&mdash;dear, good Marta&mdash;may I have some of
that stuff that smells like flowers? I smelt it on
those foreign ladies when they took out their
handkerchiefs at the Marina."</p>

<p>"There'll be only enough for the dress and the
shoes to&ndash;day, <i>carina</i>."  Marta was sorry to deny
the child.</p>

<p>Pappina took the woman's hand.</p>

<p>"<i>Vieni</i>, Marta. We must hurry or everything
will be sold to the foreigners. They have so much
money they even throw it away. My dress must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
be red, and red is so beautiful! If we don't
hurry. I'm sure they'll have it all. Please, Marta,
aren't you ready?"</p>

<p>Marta had not the heart to keep the eager child
waiting, and
they started  at
once.</p><br />

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-034.jpg" width="400" height="490"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">It was not they</p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1">Pappina
walked as
though on air,
by Marta's side,
looking at everything,
prattling
in her inimitable
way. Marta was
beginning to feel
that even for herself
life still held
some charm.</p>

<p>The child had not once thought of home.
She had been too absorbed in the newness of
everything. Suddenly she caught sight of two
ragged boys asleep on the ground, with their
empty baskets over their faces. She stopped
beside them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Marta, wait!" she commanded. "Maybe it's
Vittorio or Filippo. Sometimes they don't come
home at night. I must see if it is my brothers."</p>

<p>A passer&ndash;by, hearing her cry, uncovered the
boys' heads. Eagerly Pappina peered into their
faces. It was not they. She burst into tears.</p>

<p>"<i>Padre</i>&mdash;<i>madre</i> [Father&mdash;mother]!&mdash;I want to
see them all! Take me home," she cried.</p>

<p>"First the pretty red dress, <i>carina</i>." Shrewd
Marta! She knew perhaps the one thing to make
the child forget.</p>

<p>The tears were dried, and hand in hand they
hurried to a shop. Pappina wanted everything
she saw in the store that was bright and pretty.</p>

<p>"Mayn't I have that shawl for my head?
Please, Marta, buy it for me!"</p>

<p>"No, <i>carina</i>&mdash;just the dress and shoes to&ndash;day.
There is money only for them."</p>

<p>Pappina's request was hardly made before she
had forgotten it because of the wonders she
beheld in the great store&mdash;show&ndash;cases filled with
ribbons of all the colors and tints of the rainbow;
cases of spools of silk; bright&ndash;colored fashion
plates, and a dazzling array of fabrics in prints,
cheesecloth, merinos, and silks.  With exclamations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
of delight the child danced about like a
butterfly from one thing to another, smiling Marta
following her.</p>

<p>When they started from the shop, Pappina
refused to let Marta carry either the shoes or the
dressgoods. She hugged them close in her arms,
every other minute peeping through the tear she
had made in the wrapping&ndash;paper.</p>

<p>"<i>Che bella, Marta, che bella</i> [How beautiful,
Marta, how beautiful]!" she exclaimed softly,
again and again.</p>

<p>"Are we going to make the dress right away,
the minute we get home, Marta?"</p>

<p>"<i>Si, si, carina.</i>"</p>

<p>"You will let me help?"</p>

<p>"Can you sew, <i>carina?</i>"</p>

<p>"My sister Angela knit when she was only four,
and I can sew, I'm sure I can. You'll let me,
won't you, Marta?&mdash;so it will be done before I go
with Signor Guiseppe?"</p>

<p>"You shall wear it this afternoon, <i>carina</i>."</p>

<p>"He'll be sure to like the color of the dress.
He can't help it, can he? Shan't I be grand,
Marta, when I have on my splendid new dress and
shoes!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>Marta, looking at the eager little upturned face,
forgot she had ever had a sorrow or a hardship.</p>

<p>It did not take long to sew up the simple little
frock, but it would certainly have been finished
quite an hour before had not Pappina insisted upon
sewing this and that. Marta, good soul, in her
keen enjoyment of the child's pleasure, considered
it no trouble to stop sewing and hold up the little
dress to be admired, to try it on some six or seven
times, and while Pappina was absorbed in her new
shoes, secretly to take out the big stitches put in
by this wild little child who would help.</p>

<p>At noon Guiseppe came home, out of sorts and
cross. His coming was like a shadow on the
happiness that Marta and Pappina felt.</p>

<p>"No money," he growled as he rattled the
Punchinellos into a corner. "I might as well have
stayed at home. I'm sick of playing to such dogs."
Pappina and Marta were silent. "Is it done?" he
asked, noticing the red dress in Marta's hands.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I'll try what youth and beauty will do. I'll
take her to the Toledo with the Punchinellos.
Can you sing, girl?" he asked turning his glowering
eyes on Pappina.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Si</i>, signor."</p>

<p>"Get up and give us a song; dance if you can.
I feed and clothe no one who can't earn what
I give."</p>

<p>He waited a moment, watching Pappina's
flashing eyes. She made no move to obey him,
but, looking at Marta who sat with downcast lids,
she followed her example of silence. In all the
poverty of her home no such crossness had ever
been shown Pappina, and she was not quick to
submit to tyranny.</p>

<p>"Why don't you do as I tell you, girl?"
exclaimed Guiseppe threateningly.</p>

<p>"Because, Signor Guiseppe, I couldn't sing
for you when you are so cross and mean. When
we go this afternoon to the Toledo, if you're good
to me, I will sing and dance, and they'll give me
money, lots of it."</p>

<p>"<i>Per bacco!</i> The minx has courage!" Guiseppe
muttered, then added gruffly: "Dress, then, at
once. We'll go and see what stuff you're made
of."</p>

<p>It was a small matter to put on the new shoes
and don the simple little frock. As Pappina
was putting on the bright dress she could hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
stand still.  It was so fine to her that she could
scarcely believe it was her own.</p>

<p>Suddenly remembering who had given her the
money with which to buy the gorgeous garment,
she ran to Guiseppe. Climbing upon his knee,
she threw her arms about his neck.</p>

<p>"Oh, Signor Guiseppe," she exclaimed, all
her anger forgotten, "look at me, quickly! I am
Pappina Pierno. You wouldn't know it, but I am
really and truly the same little girl. Do I look
well? Are you proud of me? Do you like my
red dress? Will every one know it is new&mdash;and
my shoes, too?"</p>

<p>She plied him with a hundred questions all
at once, it seemed to Guiseppe, who had never
before had a child in his home. He did not even
like children, and yet he felt a delight in having
this impetuous little beauty dash at him and in
her excitement nearly knock him off his chair.</p>

<p>"<i>Bella bambina!</i>" he exclaimed involuntarily,
while good Marta smiled at the sight.</p>

<p>All was now in readiness. Guiseppe, Marta
and Pappina, with the Punchinellos, were off.</p>

<p>For years Guiseppe and Maria had not walked
side by side. Guiseppe had a way of going ahead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
letting Marta follow like a faithful dog after his
master. To&ndash;day, as usual, Guiseppe took the lead,
striding through the network of lanes and streets
certain that Marta with Pappina was close at his
heels. But everything was so new to Pappina
that progress was slow.</p>

<p>Every minute she would beg Marta to stop
while she feasted her eyes on the wonders of the
shop windows; and Marta was torn between
her desire to please the child, who had already
brought so much pleasure into her hard life, and
her desire to avoid angering Guiseppe.</p>

<p>"Oh, Marta, can't you wait just a minute to see
these pretty things?" Pappina would exclaim,
stopping at a jeweler's.</p>

<p>"Not to&ndash;day, <i>carina</i>&mdash;another day. Now we
must hurry."</p>

<p>"But just to see these pictures&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, <i>carina</i>, look! Guiseppe is far ahead.
It is there at the bend of the street by that statue
that he always stops when he plays on the Toledo."</p>

<p>At the mention of the Toledo, Pappina was only
too ready to hurry along with Marta. So, half
running, they reached Guiseppe's side just as he
set up the Punchinellos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>Pappina, looking with disappointment up and
down the street, asked: "Marta, is this the
Toledo?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then where are all the grand people in their
fine carriages?"</p>

<p>"The grand people have nearly all gone away
from Naples, away to the coast, where it is cool,"
Marta replied.</p>

<p>The crowd was now considered large enough to
warrant a performance of the show.</p>

<p>Pappina was the most interested of the
spectators. When she had seen the show with
Filippo she had been so absorbed in the puppets'
actions that she had not noticed it was Guiseppe
who moved them, spoke for them with a change
of voice, and lived through all their passions for
them. To&ndash;day, standing close to him, she understood.
She looked wonderingly, first at him, then
at the puppets, and knowing that it was all make&ndash;believe,
she did not cry out against the villain's
actions.</p>

<p>When the play was finished, both Pappina and
Marta passed through the crowd to collect the
pay for the performance, but there were only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
few <i>soldi</i> from the sprinkling of soldiers&mdash;nothing
more.</p>

<p>Guiseppe was on the point of bursting out in
angry abuse when he bethought himself.</p>

<p>"Try your luck, girl," he said roughly to
Pappina. "Sing, dance, give us a gay one."</p>

<p>Pappina hesitated, then she looked at her new
dress and shoes, took up her tambourine, and began
to sing.</p>

<p>The liquid notes poured forth as from the
throat of a nightingale. She forgot the people and
where she was, forgot everything but her song.
Her voice rang out so clear and pure that even the
lazy, loafing boys threw away their cigarettes and
joined the crowd that was holding its breath to
catch the silvery sweetness of the tiny singer's
song.</p>

<p>The last notes were unheard, so loud were the
cheers they gave her.</p>

<p>Guiseppe, the money&ndash;lover, was chuckling with
pleasure and anticipation.</p>

<p>"Pass your tambourine," he commanded.</p>

<p>The ragged boys dived into their pockets to
see if there was even <i>un soldo</i> to give. Young
black&ndash;haired, bareheaded women found a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
coin or two. Pale&ndash;faced Neapolitan loafers with
the drapery of their cloaks thrown over their
shoulders, having nothing to offer but shouts of
approval, slunk away before the tambourine
reached them. Old women all rags and fangs,
weak little girls supporting big babies, eager to
hear another song, tried in vain to find something
for the singer.</p>

<p>What little there was in the tambourine
Guiseppe soon had in his pocket.</p>

<p>"The girl's too good for such beggars," he said
as he took up the Punchinellos and started down
the street.</p>

<p>Pappina, pleased with his praise, walked
proudly beside him, prattling, humming, laughing,
pointing here and there, enthusiastic over every
new thing she saw.</p>

<p>"Guiseppe, where are we going now?" she
inquired.</p>

<p>It was a question Marta had longed to ask,
but had not dared. The change in Guiseppe was
too recent for Marta to believe he would continue
good&ndash;tempered long.</p>

<p>Certainly since hearing Pappina sing, Guiseppe
had seemed in good spirits. The visions of much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
money cheered him so that he was gracious even
to Marta.</p>

<p>"We are going now to Porta Capuana, songstress,"
he laughingly replied. Noticing Marta's
surprised look, he added kindly to her: "I've
never done well there myself, but if all those others
can make a living there I guess Pappina can draw
the money with her voice."</p>

<p>Porta Capuana is a quarter of Naples where
street singers congregate. Here, also, one may
find public readers who follow in the footsteps of
ancient poets like Homer and tell their stories to
the public in person instead of through the cold
type of the printer.</p>

<p>Pappina, proud of Guiseppe's praise, smiled
happily into his face and walked close by his side,
in her childish way holding with one hand a corner
of his coat.</p>

<p>The almost deafening shouts of the quack
doctors trying to sell their cure&ndash;alls, and stopping
occasionally to pull teeth, frightened Pappina.
She clung so tightly to Guiseppe's coat that he
turned to look at her. Her bright, happy expression
had changed to one of fear. Guiseppe
took hold of her trembling hand, reassured her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
and leading her to a place where the quacks and
their victims were out of sight, he said in the
kindest tone he had ever used:</p>

<p>"<i>Canta</i> [Sing], <i>bambina</i>."</p>

<p>Away from the din, with loving Marta on one
side, protecting Guiseppe on the other, Pappina
quickly forgot her fear. She sang and danced;
money was given freely. She was happy. She
and Guiseppe were the best of friends, and they
were having a glorious time.</p>

<p>Such noise and such bustle! Such scenes and
such macaroni!</p>

<p>Guiseppe apparently was really enjoying Pappina's
happiness. He looked pleased when she
smiled into his face, patted his sleeve, pulled his
coat or squeezed his big hand, always willing to
sing and do his bidding.</p>

<p>It was a good day for them all. It passed
only too quickly for Pappina, who did not wish
to go home, and begged to stay to see the lights
and hear the band. She gave in sweetly when she
was refused, however, and was taken home and put
to bed, too tired after the exciting day to think
once of the loved ones in San Lucia.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="pn center slarge"><span class="smcap">Feste Day in Naples</span></p>

<p class="pn p2">Italy, the land of sunshine! Its hills and valleys,
churches and palaces are famous for their
historic treasures. But when the sightseers arrive
to view this birthplace of history they are
annoyed on every hand by hoards of <i>lazzaroni</i>
(beggars). Every one seems hungry for money.</p>

<p>Now that Guiseppe had possession of Pappina
he felt himself in a fair way to appease his hunger,
for, with all the poverty surrounding the splendid
churches and palaces, the people of Italy are
joyous and mirthloving, and give freely to those
who amuse them.</p>

<p>For a couple of weeks after securing control
of Pappina, Guiseppe reaped a harvest such as
had never before been his fortune, while Pappina
was having the very gayest time of her little life.</p>

<p>Every day she was quite as eager as Guiseppe
to set forth, although they were in search of
different things&mdash;Pappina coveting the smiles and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
applause of the lords and ladies who seemed to
her like beings from another world, Guiseppe eager
for gold.</p>

<p>Every morning they would start out for some
new quarter of the city which was visited by
tourists and held mysteries for Pappina. It meant
money to have these foreigners admire the child.
Every one stopped to listen to her. She was kept
singing, dancing, here, there, and everywhere, it
seemed to her. Many times she was willful, and
would stubbornly refuse to obey Guiseppe.</p><br />

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p class="p1">"I'm tired of singing and dancing and being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
stared at," she would say, with a determined look
on her little face that warned the man not to
force her. "I've earned enough for to&ndash;day."</p>

<p>The child would always assert her independence
when among people, and at a time quite impossible
for Guiseppe to discipline her.</p>

<p>It is well that these two high&ndash;tempered people
had Marta always with them. Often she was able
to keep the peace when an outbreak threatened.
Pappina loved her, and would listen to and obey
her when no threats from Guiseppe could move
her.</p>

<p>As the first Sunday in June drew near, preparations
were begun for the Festival of the Constitution,
the Italian Fourth of July; and to the
nearness of this fete day Marta was indebted for
many an opportunity to make the child forget
Guiseppe when he showed an ugly temper.</p>

<p>Stores were draped with bunting. On all
the principal streets arches were erected, and
every man, woman, and child seemed to be
preparing for it. Even Guiseppe made ready
for the fete. Late one forenoon he took a sudden
turn into the Corso Garibaldi and hurried
down its broad walk at such a pace that even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
Pappina was almost breathless in trying to keep
up with him.</p>

<p>"Where are you going now, Guiseppe?" she
asked, seizing hold of him. "Is there a crowd
some place, that you hurry so?"</p>

<p>Marta listened eagerly for a reply. It was a
never&ndash;ending source of astonishment to her that
Guiseppe would answer the child's questions without
impatience; she, herself, rarely received a
pleasant word from him.</p>

<p>"You see, <i>bambina</i>," the heavy&ndash;browed man
graciously replied with a good&ndash;natured twinkle
in his bright black eyes, "you are so fine since
you have your red dress, old Guiseppe thinks he
must get a new coat, and so we're on our way to
Porta Nolana."</p>

<p>"But Marta bought my new dress over there in
the shops, where there is everything in the world,"
exclaimed Pappina, waving her little hand over
her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Ah, but I don't buy, I trade, little one.
It's Rag Fair day."</p>

<p>"Rag Fair day," Pappina repeated, wrinkling
her forehead. There were so many things to
wonder about these days that she did not question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
him further, but trotted along by his side, until
suddenly she found herself among a throng of
chattering, bartering men and women, who were
offering all kinds of garments for sale or exchange.</p>

<p>Guiseppe stopped and, handing the Punchinellos
to Marta, stripped off his coat. Pappina
stood with wide&ndash;open eyes and lips parted in amazement
to see him offer his coat for a better one,
with one franc&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;then five&mdash;and the
exchange was made.</p>

<p>When at last Guiseppe donned his good coat,
Pappina told him over and over again, to his
amusement: "Guiseppe, you look just lovely."</p>

<p>"You like my coat, <i>bambina?</i>" he said. "Then
come along. It takes money to buy good coats
and bright red dresses."</p>

<p>Taking Pappina's hand, he strolled buoyantly
away from the noisy Rag Fair, toward the
Observatory, beyond which some of the wealthy
Neapolitans have their homes.</p>

<p>Up the hilly streets they climbed. Pappina,
darting ahead on explorations, would stop at each
corner as she came to it and wait for Guiseppe
and Marta.</p>

<p>"Keep your eyes open for a likely house where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
they will pay for entertainment," urged Guiseppe,
who was as much a stranger in this new quest for
money as was Marta.</p>

<p>At the two or three places at which they
stopped the voice of the little girl rose through
the heated afternoon air, but only a few <i>soldi</i>
tinkled on the pavement.</p>

<p>If Guiseppe was disappointed he did not show
any signs of it. He smiled calmly upon Pappina.</p>

<p>"We'll save your voice and strength for
to&ndash;morrow, <i>bambina</i>. Not another song to&ndash;day.
Come along, Marta. Old Guiseppe's getting to
be a kind master, eh, Pappina?"</p>

<p>His was a selfish kindness. He knew the
morrow's fete would prove a harvest to him, and
since no one gave to&ndash;day, he thought best to let
Pappina rest for the fete day's strain.</p>

<p>When the bright, beautiful fete morning
dawned, Guiseppe was early astir.</p>

<p>"Come, Marta! Up, little one!" he exclaimed.
"The day can neither begin too soon nor last too
long for me."</p>

<p>"Nor for me," declared Pappina.</p>

<p>First they, with every one else, must go to mass
in the handsome church San Francesco di Paola.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>The thunder of guns from the vessels of war
and the harbor batteries frightened Pappina.
She held Marta's hand tightly and sometimes
in her fear even Guiseppe's, but when she saw the
militia she forgot the noise.</p>

<p>"Oh, I like the soldiers," she cried happily.
It was the first military parade she had ever
seen, and she wanted to follow the marching
troops down the street and lend her cheers to
those of the crowd.</p>

<p>How grand the carriages were! How gay the
people looked, tricked out in all the magnificence
they could command! Pappina, looking at the
surging mass of holiday&ndash;makers, asked: "Marta,
is the whole world here to&ndash;day?"</p>

<p>Days before the fete Pappina had been taught
to sing the Garibaldi. Guiseppe knew well the
effect the song would have upon the people. For
years he had sung it himself on fete day, but that
was before he had his Punchinellos, before his voice
had grown thin and cracked. Time and again
he had scolded Marta because neither she nor the
puppets could sing the Garibaldi.</p>

<p>Now he had a child with voice and beauty.
As they paused at a crowded corner where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
thought it would be well to have her sing, he looked
at her with satisfaction. He had talked to her so
much of the applause and <i>soldi</i> she would win
that she could scarcely curb her impatience to
begin. Like a high&ndash;bred, prancing horse eager to
run, she stood with her gayly decorated tambourine
ready, anxiously waiting for Guiseppe to bid
her sing. When he said, "<i>Canta</i>," she needed no
second bidding. Wildly she struck her tambourine.
Her voice rang out:</p>

<p>"<i>Viva! Viva! Viva!</i> Garibaldi!"</p>

<p>Such a din of applause! She could scarcely
hear her own voice, but loudly she continued:
"<i>Viva! Viva!</i> Victor Emanuel!"</p>

<p>She need not pass her tambourine to&ndash;day.
She need not even stop to pick up the <i>soldi</i> as they
rained upon her. That was Marta and Guiseppe's
pleasant task.</p>

<p>"Bravo! Bravo! Encore! Encore!" the
crowd shouted, and Pappina sang the song over
and over again.</p>

<p>As one throng left for new sights and amusements
another took its place, and so the tambourine
was filled again and again. Yet Guiseppe
kept her singing and dancing, dancing and singing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Never, it seemed to Marta, would he be satisfied
to let the child rest.</p>

<p>The woman noticed with anxiety and pain the
bright, feverish spots burning on Pappina's cheeks,
and the unusual brilliancy of her great black eyes.
Several times she made bold to ask Guiseppe if
she might not take the child home, but Guiseppe
replied only with glances of contempt and indignation
at her interference.</p>

<p>Even the buoyancy of youth must give way
to fatigue after a time, and Pappina's little limbs
began to ache. She sat down to rest.</p>

<p>"Get up, girl. We must be moving," said
Guiseppe.</p>

<p>Pappina arose.</p>

<p>"Take me home, Guiseppe," she begged,
"I'm so tired." The request was ignored.</p>

<p>"There's a crowd up the street; come," was
all the man said.</p>

<p>Pappina's bright eyes spied an empty carriage
on the thoroughfare. All her little life since she
could remember, she had longed for a ride in a
carriage; here was her first chance for one and she
grasped it.</p>

<p>"I'm too tired to walk, Guiseppe," she said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
quietly. "I'm going home now, and I'm going to
ride, for I've earned lots of money to&ndash;day."</p>

<p>Guiseppe took no notice of the remark.</p>

<p>"Come on, I say!" he growled. "Don't you
see that crowd? Come!"</p>

<p>"Guiseppe, I'm going home, and I'm going to
ride, for I've earned lots of money to&ndash;day."
Pappina repeated, stepping, as she spoke, into the
carriage.</p>

<p>What was Guiseppe to do? They were still
among a crowd of people who had poured <i>soldi</i>
and <i>soldi</i>, even francs, into her tambourine.
Should he attempt to discipline her and have a
scene on this public, crowded thoroughfare? He
looked savagely at Pappina seated in the carriage,
her proud little head resting against the cushions
like that of a princess. He could not doubt that
she intended to ride. Should he humor her?
He stood a moment in deep study. The people
were smiling admiringly at the dainty child.
Guiseppe knew their sympathy was with Pappina.
He could not hide his anger.</p>

<p>"Confound her!" he muttered. "Get in, Marta,"
he commanded with an oath.</p>

<p>There is no knowing what, in his rage, Guiseppe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
would not have said and done had not Pappina
fallen asleep almost immediately. It was poor
Marta who was destined to feel the fury of his rage.</p>

<p>"She always takes advantage of me when I
can't help myself," he began. "The upstart!
Am I, Guiseppe, to give in to her, an imp raised
in poverty and dirt?" He beat his hand on
his breast. "Marta, I'll show her. I'll teach
her who is master. I'll curb her temper. I'll
conquer her or I'll die. Bah! Do you hear me?
I say I'll conquer her or I'll die."</p>

<p>Marta certainly heard him and believed him
as well. He had made her life a hard one, insisting
upon having his own selfish way always. She
was expected to know no wish that differed from
his. No wonder he felt galled to find himself
defied, forced to give in to a child who in years was
scarcely more than a baby.</p>

<p>Marta was in constant fear that the little girl
might awaken and that Guiseppe would be eager
to fulfill his threat to show Pappina who was
master. But Pappina slept on, even after the
carriage had stopped in front of their home.</p>

<p>Marta took the tired little girl quickly and
tenderly in her arms and put her to bed, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
heart overflowing with a great motherly love as
though Pappina were her very own. For a long
time she sat by the child's side, to guard her
from Guiseppe's anger. She could hear him in
the adjoining room, pacing the floor like a lion in
his cage. Then there was silence.</p>

<p>What now! Marta held her breath as she tiptoed
to the door and peered through a crack to
see what Guiseppe was doing. He had his money bag
in his hand.</p>

<p>"Full! Full!" he exclaimed softly. He smiled
grimly as he counted the coins. "<i>Diavolo!</i> she
brings the money! Ten&mdash;twenty.&mdash;She's a gold
mine, the vixen!&mdash;Thirty&mdash;forty.&mdash;I can afford
to give in a little.&mdash;Fifty.&mdash;What spirit she has!&mdash;Sixty.&mdash;I
could kill her at times, but&mdash;seventy&ndash;five&mdash;I'll
be hanged if I don't like her!&mdash;Eighty.&mdash;Yes,
I like her&mdash;temper and all."</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="pn center slarge"><span class="smcap">In the Valley of Pompeii</span></p>

<p class="pn p2">Marta was awake early the morning after the
fete. She hurried to Pappina's cot and found
the child ill. It was as she had feared: the
excitement had proved too much for the little one.
The wonder&ndash;child lay pale and listless. Her black
eyes were drowsy.</p>

<p>Marta was bathing the feverish brow and hands
when Guiseppe, returning from an errand, angrily
asked why they were not ready to start on the
day's rounds.</p>

<p>"Ready to start!" Marta cried. "Have you
no eyes except for money? Look at her! Do
you not see that it is impossible to keep the child
always singing and dancing?"</p>

<p>Only for the sake of Pappina had Marta dared
be so brave. Guiseppe was astonished. This was
a new Marta to him. That his wife, who had so
patiently borne with him for so long a time, should
turn on him, was more than he was prepared for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Basta, basta</i> [Enough, enough]!" he said,
raising his hand to silence Marta. Then he glanced
toward the cot. He could see how pale and still
Pappina lay. "It's early yet. An hour in bed
will put her right."</p>

<p>"An hour!" Marta exclaimed, darting up to him
in her indignation at his heartlessness. "Do you
wish to kill the hen that lays the golden eggs?"</p>

<p>"She laid many yesterday," he replied, taking
out his money&ndash;bag. "They are all in here,
francs and <i>soldi</i>, and there are many of them."
He patted the bag affectionately, looked again at
Pappina, and added: "I'll let her rest. It's
quiet after the fete, and I can't lose much to&ndash;day."</p>

<p>"To&ndash;day! Guiseppe, she shall not leave the
house till she is quite well. You know how high&ndash;strung
and sensitive she is, like a golden lute
that responds to the slightest touch of any breeze,
no matter how mild and soft. You must let her
rest. You must, Guiseppe." Marta had gone
close to her husband and was looking earnestly
and pleadingly into his face.</p>

<p>"I'll not break her down and lose her,"
Guiseppe replied. "She did well at the fete.
After all, what will a few days matter?" He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
walked to the little cot and continued: "I know
you, <i>bambina</i>, I know you. If you don't feel
right you may as well stay at home, for you
can't sing and you won't dance."</p>

<p>He turned with a shrug of his shoulders,
picked up the Punchinello stage, and left the
house.</p>

<p>Pappina dozed all through the long day, with
Marta keeping close watch by her side.</p>

<p>Late that evening Guiseppe came in stealthily.
He found his supper waiting him.</p>

<p>"All right again, Marta?" he questioned.</p>

<p>"A few days' rest is all she needs," Marta answered,
thankful that he was not ill&ndash;natured, and
pleased that he had inquired about the child.</p>

<p>For several days Guiseppe went out alone with
the Punchinellos. He missed Pappina, and the
money he earned was not worth the time and
trouble it cost him to give the show.</p>

<p>"It's no use," he said to Marta one evening
as he came in. "The foreigners have sought
the cool resorts. The wealth of Naples is leaving
also. It's along the coast they go to enjoy the
fresh breezes of the Bay of Naples, and we may as
well follow them and their money."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>This announcement surprised Marta, for since
her marriage she had never been away from
Naples.</p>

<p>"You really mean we are going away?&mdash;away
from Naples?&mdash;away from home?"</p>

<p>"What's the use of staying in Naples?" he
growled. "It's money I want&mdash;money, I say.
Old Parisotti goes down the coast every year.
His old guitar isn't fit to listen to; neither can
that girl of his sing. We have Pappina, and as
soon as she's able we'll go."</p>

<p>Marta carried the news to Pappina, who was
sitting up. She clapped her hands softly.</p>

<p>"Can we go soon, Marta?" she cried.</p>

<p>"As soon as you are well enough, <i>carina</i>.
It is beautiful along the coast. You will like
to be away from the crowded city&mdash;away, <i>carina</i>,
where the birds sing, the flowers grow, the grass
and trees are green, and the air is cool and fresh."</p>

<p>Before the end of the week Pappina came to
breakfast and announced: "I'm ready to start,
and I want to go at once."</p>

<p>All dimples and smiles, she went to Guiseppe
and sat uninvited on his knee. Looking into
his eyes, she asked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>"Guiseppe, are you angry with me?"</p>

<p>He was surprised and pleased. If there was
a warm spot in Guiseppe's heart she had touched
it. He took Pappina's face between his rough,
broad hands.</p>

<p>"There, there, <i>carina</i>," he said, "Guiseppe's
a  bear&mdash;old and often crabbed. Just forget his
faults and try to like him."</p>

<p>He pushed her almost roughly off his lap and
began his morning repast. Guiseppe admitted
to himself that he had missed the little elf while
she was ill, more than he would like any one to
know. He considered the feeling a weakness,
and would not permit Pappina and Marta to see
how glad, even happy he was to have the child
well again.</p>

<p>"She must not know how angry my heart has
been against her. She must not know how I
have missed her, with her moods, her storms, her
sunshine, and her prattle," he said to himself
as he sat stolidly trying to conceal his pleasure.</p>

<p>Pappina, having little appetite, was soon away
from the table, imitating the tarantella dancers,
to the great amusement of both Marta and
Guiseppe. Tiring of this, she ran first to Marta,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
whom she gave a big squeeze, then around the
table to Guiseppe, about whose neck she put both
arms.</p>

<p>"Guiseppe, dear Guiseppe," she cried, "I'm
so glad we're going away! I'm tired of being shut
up in the house. When shall we go? To&ndash;day,
good Guiseppe?"</p>

<p>Guiseppe laid down his knife and fork. His
face lighted up with pleasure as he took Pappina's
two little hands caressingly in his.</p>

<p>"Marta!" he exclaimed, "do you hear what
she calls me? 'Good Guiseppe!' <i>Per bacco</i>, I
have never before been called good! Do you mean
it, <i>bambina?</i>"</p>

<p>"I do, Guiseppe; truly I do!"</p>

<p>"Then, if I'm good, I'll see that my little one
is quite strong before she is taken on a long,
hard tramp, with plenty of singing and dancing
wherever we meet people."</p>

<p>He kept his word. In spite of Pappina's
impatience to be off, it was several days before
he would consent to start.</p>

<p>As the wardrobe of the three consisted principally
of the clothes on their backs, there was little
to do but lock the door of their humble two&ndash;roomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
home, take the Punchinellos, and start out of
Naples, through the noisy, bustling east suburb.</p>

<p>Along the busy streets Guiseppe marched, as
though walking for a wager&mdash;past various markets,
with fish, vegetables, and carts of oranges standing
outside; past houses where women sat in the sun
mending fish&ndash;nets or spinning from distaffs;
through crowds of unwashed, ragged children,
beggars, carts, red&ndash;capped fishermen and sailors;
on through the wild confusion of horses, donkeys,
drivers, and people such as one sees nowhere in the
world but in this part of Naples.</p>

<p>Guiseppe had promised himself to stop at the
villas, but here he was going past villas and palaces,
gardens and vineyards, down the country roads
that lead to Vesuvius and Pompeii, without
any apparent notice of anything they were passing.
He looked neither to right nor left, but with bowed
head walked mechanically on. Marta and Pappina
followed close behind their stolid leader. No
one spoke.</p>

<p>Just at the outskirts of the city, they passed
the macaroni factories, where Pappina saw long
strips and strings of macaroni hung out on poles in
the street to dry. She gazed longingly at the food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"I want some, Marta. Tell Guiseppe I want
some macaroni," she said, but before Marta could
reply, they turned a bend in the road and Pappina
saw for the first time Vesuvius, puffing out great
volumes of smoke against the clear blue sky.
Visible as this mountain is from some parts of
Naples, Pappina had not seen it before. The
tall tenements of gloomy San Lucia, with lines
upon lines of garments everlastingly hanging out
to dry between the balconies or from poles thrust
out, completely hide the volcano from the view
of those living where the Piernos had their home.</p>

<p>"O&mdash;oh, Marta!" Pappina exclaimed, pausing
abruptly. "Marta! Look! See! What is it?"
she cried, pointing to attract Marta's attention.</p>

<p>Marta was hastening along to keep up with Guiseppe
and hardly glanced at the smoke&ndash;crowned
mountain, which was an old sight to her.</p>

<p>"What is it, Marta?" Pappina persisted as
she caught up with the woman.</p>

<p>"Vesuvius, <i>carina</i>."</p>

<p>"Where does all the smoke come from?
Where's the fire?"</p>

<p>Marta told Pappina all she knew about it:</p>

<p>"Travelers from all parts of the world come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
and climb the volcano to look down into the crater,
the mouth from which the smoke comes. I
went up once with Countess Filota. People melt
coins in the lava&mdash;that's the melted rock that
comes out with the smoke. Sometimes the guides
boil eggs over the lava to show how hot it is."</p>

<p>"Marta, can't we go up? Weren't you afraid
to look down into the mouth?"</p>

<p>"No, <i>carina</i>. They tell the story of an Englishman
who went too close and fell in, but that was
because of his own carelessness. There is no
danger. Perhaps sometime we shall be able to go,
so you can see for yourself."</p>

<p>On and on they marched, with the pillar of
smoke ever before them. Pappina could not overcome
the awe she felt at first sight of this great
furnace of Nature.</p>

<p>The walk down the dusty road through
Posilipo awakened memories in Marta's heart.
She spoke, more to herself than to Pappina:</p>

<p>"How long it is since I came here with my
dear Countess Filota! She and her friends spoke
of Cicero and  Virgil, their homes beneath this
hillside. We turned and went&mdash;let me see, which
way was it? It is so long ago I have almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
forgotten. Oh! this  way, to  the left and we
visited the tomb of Virgil; we&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who were they, Marta?" Pappina interrupted
her, "friends of your Countess Filota?"</p>

<p>Marta was too deep in her memories to be
amused at the child's question.</p>

<p>"No, no, <i>carina</i>. They were great poets.
I wish you might&mdash;" She left the sentence unfinished,
for glancing toward Guiseppe, plodding
ahead, she noticed something queer in his gait.
She ran forward, calling: "Guiseppe! What's
the matter, Guiseppe?"</p>

<p>Guiseppe turned at the call and stopped, facing
them. As they drew near, Marta saw that he was
breathing hard and that his face was drawn and
white.</p>

<p>"I'm not well, Marta," he gasped as they
reached him. "My legs and breath shouldn't
give out like this. It won't do. I tell you.
I'm not well."</p>

<p>He flung himself down on the ground. This
was the first complaint of illness Marta had ever
heard him make. She was alarmed, and she
showed it. Guiseppe reassured her.</p>

<p>"We'll stop at the Valley of Pompeii. We'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
go to the church Santa Maria dell Rosario [Saint
Mary of the Rosary]. It will do us all good to pray.
The blessed Virgin makes the blind see and
the lame walk. She cured Genario's boy who
had been sick two years. She'll make me
well."</p>

<p>He crossed himself, and lay back, closing his
eyes. Marta and Pappina sat watching the sick
man. For some time he lay as though sleeping,
then suddenly he sat up.</p>

<p>"Marta," he cried, "we need food. I can't
move on to&ndash;night. Go, bring us something."</p>

<p>Marta hesitated a moment, wondering if it were
best to leave him. He commanded her again
to go for food.</p>

<p>"I'm faint," he said, "and the girl's tired and
hungry&mdash;but she has grit; she don't whimper
and snivel as any other child would do. Get something
for us to eat. We'll stay here. Where
are we, Marta? Do you know?"</p>

<p>"The town is called Resina," Marta replied,
as she tried to make him comfortable before
obeying his command. Before she started she
bade Pappina watch over Guiseppe carefully
while she was away, but there was nothing for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
the child to do but sit quiet and await Marta's
return.</p>

<p>The woman was soon back with the food
bought in the near&ndash;by village. Guiseppe only
grunted when Marta sought to make him partake
of the food. Little enough she had been able to
buy with the few coins given her; but both
Pappina and Marta were used to this. They
took what they could get, and expected nothing
more.</p>

<p>The three were soon asleep under the calm
starlight and awoke only when the morning sun,
peeping through the branches of the trees, shone
brightly into their faces. After eating a little
breakfast, they started down the road toward the
Valley of Pompeii, with slow steps to accommodate
the sick man. Undoubtedly Guiseppe felt himself
very ill.</p>

<p>"Hasten, so that I can get to the Virgin of
Santa Rosario before I die," he kept exclaiming,
as they helped him along.</p>

<p>After many stops to rest Guiseppe, they arrived
at the chateau of "La Favorita," with its fine
park. As soon as she saw the great iron gateway
Pappina darted away without a word. Guiseppe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a><br /><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>smiled as he watched her disappear and heard
the rattle of her tambourine&mdash;always music in
his ears because it meant to him the jingle of money
as well as of bells.</p><br />

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-070.jpg" width="400" height="576"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">La Favorita</p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1">Marta, looking up the avenue of fine trees that
led to the chateau, saw a group of ladies and
gentlemen, sitting on the lawn. Before them
the little red&ndash;dressed figure was swaying in its
dance, and she heard the sweet voice singing.</p>

<p>"Oh, Guiseppe," she exclaimed, "live, live, for
we have her, the wonder&ndash;child! Rest while she
sings and listen to her angel voice. It will bring
you strength to reach the Holy Virgin's church,
where you surely will be healed."</p>

<p>Guiseppe was glad to rest. Without a reply
to Marta he sat down and listened to the strains
of the song that floated to them.</p>

<p>"<i>Cara bambina!</i>" he murmured softly. His
sickness seemed to be changing, softening him.
His eyes almost sparkled with pleasure when
he saw Pappina running toward him.</p>

<p>"Guiseppe, they were splendid to me!" she
cried. "A grand gentleman gave me this," showing
a franc. "He told me to keep it myself, that
it was all for me, but it's yours, Guiseppe. Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
I can't bear to have you sick," said the child,
smiling through her tears.</p>

<p>Guiseppe patted her little hand as he took the
proffered coin.</p>

<p>The sight of money turned his thoughts to
getting on, and soon they arrived as one little
party of a hundred thousand yearly seekers of
health at the gray old church of Santa Maria
del Rosario.</p>

<p>"Shall I sing?" asked Pappina as soon as she
saw the crowds.</p>

<p>"First we must pray," Marta answered, taking
the child's hand.</p>

<p>As soon as they entered the broad portals of
the church, Guiseppe dropped to his knees, and
thus he crept, with many others who were especially
seeking health, toward the altar, mumbling
his prayers as he counted his beads. Reaching
the altar, he flung himself down before the dull,
dim image of the Virgin, praying for the blessing
of health.</p>

<p>Pappina and Marta, after saying a short prayer,
stopped for a few minutes to look at the medallions
covering the walls, then followed other visitors to
the place in the church where the offerings of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
healed are exhibited&mdash;a motley collection of baby
dresses, shawls, dolls, jewels, and other articles
of every kind and description.</p>

<p>Pappina, after a time, grew tired of looking
at this display, and begged Marta to go outside to
wait for Guiseppe.</p>

<p>They sat down near the church and watched
the crowds of pilgrims going in and coming out.
For a long time there was silence.</p>

<p>"So long ago," murmured Marta.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Pappina, "he's been praying
hours, hasn't he?"</p>

<p>"I was not speaking of Guiseppe, Pappina,
but of my life so long ago, when I was maid to the
Countess Filota. We took this same trip, but
we rode in carriages. We did not come to this
church. We stopped at the ruins of Pompeii."</p>

<p>"Where are they, Marta?"</p>

<p>"There, <i>carina</i>. You can see them dimly in
the distance," she said, pointing toward them,
"perhaps half a mile from here. How I should like
to see them again! I wish we had time to go."</p>

<p>The woman was silent. She seemed to be
dreaming of by&ndash;gone days. Pappina waited for
a time for Marta to speak, then she gently laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
her hand on that of her friend, saying: "Go on
Marta, tell me about them."</p>

<p>"You are such a child, <i>carina</i>. You wish
to know about the ruins? Every one who visits
Italy comes to Vesuvius and Pompeii&mdash;Vesuvius
the mountain, and Pompeii the city that once
waked and slept at the foot of the mountain.
One day the sky grew dark, completely hidden
by the volumes of smoke that rose like a huge pine
tree from Vesuvius. The stones, lava and ashes
entirely buried the city and the people, and now
when men dig in the ruins they find&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm well, Marta! I'm well, Pappina! Praise
the Santa Maria del Rosario! Come."</p>

<p>It was Guiseppe who was hurrying toward
them. He led the way to a spot a short distance
from the church. He set up the Punchinellos;
the light of money hunger again burned in his eyes,
and until the worshipers thinned out he kept
playing the puppets at intervals between Pappina's
songs and dances. In the good spirits due to
the miracles performed in the healing, the healed
gave generously to the showman.</p>

<p>"Come," he commanded Marta and the child
late in the afternoon. "We must move on to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
Cava. To&ndash;morrow is fete day there and we must
reach the place to&ndash;night."</p>

<p>Guiseppe was himself again.</p>

<p>He took no notice of Pappina's lagging footsteps,
showed no appreciation of her thoughtfulness
during his illness, being absorbed in visions of
her tambourine full of coins on the morrow. He
walked so rapidly that Marta and Pappina could
hardly keep up with him.</p>

<p>Reaching Pagani, he stopped near the main
road of the little hamlet.</p>

<p>"Sing," he commanded in an ugly tone.</p>

<p>Pappina was tired. Guiseppe had been so
cross all the way from Pompeii that she did not
care to please him.</p>

<p>"I won't!" she answered in quite as ugly a
tone as the man had used to her.</p>

<p>"Won't sing, eh? No songs, no supper,"
he muttered, half tempted to shake her in his rage.</p>

<p>Pappina was even more hungry than tired,
so she sang and danced, without any spirit, to
the few people who gathered around them just
a very tired, dusty little girl singing for her
supper.</p>

<p>The smallness of the sum collected enraged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Guiseppe, and as soon as the people left he began
to upbraid her.</p>

<p>"You're a disgrace to me and yourself," he
said. "I might as well have let my puppets dance.
You did no better." With that he made his way
to a little shop near by.</p>

<p>Pappina bit her lips.</p>

<p>"If I were not so hungry," she whispered to
Marta, her eyes blazing as she gazed after Guiseppe,
"I'd show him, but I'm so hungry!"</p>

<p>"Come on," growled the man as he emerged
from the shop and gave them their share of the
food he had purchased. "It's six miles to Cava,
and we must get there to&ndash;night, so eat as you go.
Come on, I say, and don't go to sleep as you walk,
you two."</p>

<p>So, worn and footsore, they moved on toward
Cava.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="pn center slarge"><span class="smcap">At Cava</span></p>


<p class="pn p2">Pappina was unaccustomed to long walks. She
felt lame, her flesh was sore, and furthermore
she could not forget Guiseppe's unkindness. It
hurt her that he had forced her to sing and dance
for her food, and then had scolded her for her
lack of animation.</p>

<p>"He said I was no better than his puppets.
I hate him!" she muttered to herself as she trudged
along in the growing dusk. "That franc was mine;
that fine gentleman gave it to me. I wish I
hadn't given it to Guiseppe. It was mine. If
any one gives me money again I'll keep it for myself.
I'll hide it away for Marta and me. Guiseppe
may starve&mdash;I shan't care. I hate him."</p>

<p>So the little girl was thinking all the way from
Pagani to Cava. The road was hard and rough.
Occasionally Pappina, her aching feet hurt by
a sharp stone, would utter a little cry, "<i>Olà</i> [Oh]!"
as she jumped aside, but except for these few exclamations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
there was complete silence. Marta,
in deep study, again and again stretched out
her bony hand and laid it caressingly on the
head of the tired little girl trudging uncomplainingly
yet sullenly along the deserted road.</p>

<p>Guiseppe was determined to reach Cava that
night. His snapping black eyes looked keenly
ahead for the spires and the lights of the village.</p>

<p>As he saw them dimly in the distance he
inwardly rejoiced that the day's tramp was almost
over. A half&ndash;mile from the village he halted
beneath a large tree which protectingly spread its
branches beside the road.</p>

<p>He leaned the Punchinello box against the
trunk of the tree and, still without speaking,
threw himself on the ground.</p>

<p>In spite of her fatigue, Pappina stood with
her hands clasped, looking at the distant lights
of Cava. Marta, rolling together her apron and
her shawl as a pillow for Pappina's head, watched
the child and waited for her to speak or move.
Pappina did neither.</p>

<p>"She is such a tired little girl," Marta said after
a few moments, as she took Pappina gently by
the hand. "<i>Vieni, carina, resta</i> [rest]."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>For a moment Pappina hung back, then she
clung to Marta in the dark and whispered: "For
you, Marta, for you, because you are good to me."</p>

<p>Marta took the child in her arms and carried
her to a resting&ndash;place. She kissed the little hand,
her whole heart going out to Pappina in love
and compassion as she blessed her with the words
"<i>Dio vi benedica. Buona notte, carissima</i> [God
bless you. Good&ndash;night, dearest]."</p>

<p>Only Guiseppe rested well. Marta felt too
keenly the wrong done Pappina to sleep at all.</p>

<p>"He'll kill the baby," her thoughts ran.
"He shows her no mercy. Oh! what can I do?
There'll be trouble&mdash;I feel it, I know it. I must
protect her. How sweet, how patient, how gentle
she is when he is good to her!"</p>

<p>Marta heard the deep breathing of Guiseppe
sleeping, heard Pappina muttering in her disturbed
slumber: "I hate him! I hate him!"</p>

<p>Guiseppe was awake at the first peep of day.
Seeing Marta bending over Pappina, he commanded
her: "Shake the willful child; bid her
get up at once. It's fete day."</p>

<p>Marta during her night's revery had determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
to protect Pappina at any cost to herself,
so she pleaded for the child:</p>

<p>"Yes, Guiseppe, it is fete day, and for that
reason you had better let Pappina rest for a little
while. She is exhausted from her long tramp
yesterday. She will have much excitement, singing
and dancing all day, even late in the evening.
We can find our breakfast and I will bring Pappina's
to her. Let her rest, I pray you, Guiseppe;
let her rest."</p>

<p>Marta stood before her husband, her worn face
shining with earnestness. Guiseppe looked at her
in surprise; then laughed brutally.</p>

<p>"Bravo, Marta!" he cried. "I didn't know
you had it in you. You want the child to sleep,
eh?" Then closing his eyes just a little, like a
tiger before he springs, he went on: "So you will
not awaken her? Then it is Guiseppe, the tyrant&mdash;eh,
Marta?&mdash;who must rudely arouse the sleeping
princess from her morning slumber."</p>

<p>As he finished speaking he moved toward
Pappina, who was tossing restlessly on her hard
couch, but Marta sprang between him and the
child.</p>

<p>"Guiseppe, I have always obeyed you, have I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
not?" she entreated in a low voice. "Look at
Pappina: her restlessness shows how tired she is.
Guiseppe, hear me! I beg you to let her sleep
and be rested for her hard day's work." Marta
leaned forward and placed her hands on the
man's arm as she went on: "I have asked few
favors, demanded none, but now for this once,
Guiseppe, I pray you grant me my request! Let
her rest!"</p>

<p>Guiseppe, hesitating, ran his hand several times
through his black hair as he looked from Marta
to Pappina, still asleep on the ground. He knit
his brow, struggling with himself as though it
were a hardship to grant his wife a favor.</p>

<p>"Guiseppe," Marta bravely began again, but
he interrupted her.</p>

<p>"Come on," he said roughly. "I'll humor you
this time. I'll let her sleep."</p>

<p>So it came about that Pappina awoke under
the big tree in the early morning sun to find herself
alone. Suddenly a great fear seized her.
Perhaps Marta and Guiseppe had gone off and left
her. She sprang up and ran to the road, looking
wildly about for them. In her terror she did not
notice the Punchinello box leaning against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
tree, and she started toward the village, crying
aloud: "Marta, Marta!"</p>

<p>Her tears flowed freely, and between her sobs
she continued to cry for Marta and occasionally
for Guiseppe. It was with Guiseppe's name half&ndash;spoken
on her lips that the little frightened
child stopped crying.</p>

<p>"Guiseppe! Gui&mdash;oh! I hate him! I hate
him more than I did last night!" The memory of
how he had treated her the day before came over
her like a flood. "It is fete day at Cava; he said
so. All I earn is mine, and when I sing the Garibaldi
I shall have my tambourine full of money.
Oh, how glad I am! Then I can go home."</p>

<p>As she hurried on, her plan grew clearer.
She would strike out for herself. Then suddenly
she stopped again, like a butterfly halted and
shifted in its course by a vagrant wind.</p>

<p>"Oh, Marta! If you were only with me, I
should not care," she sobbed.</p>

<p>Buffeted by conflicting feelings, Pappina sped
on toward the village of Cava.</p>

<p>Marta ate but little. She started back to find
Pappina, leaving Guiseppe to finish his breakfast
alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>"She'll like what I have brought her," she
took pleasure in thinking as she approached the
spot where they had camped for the night. She
saw no signs of Pappina astir. "She's still asleep,
tired out, poor baby! I'm so glad Guiseppe let
her rest."</p>

<p>She smiled on the friendly tree as she neared
its welcome shade. She peeped around the trunk;
no one was there. Down went the bowl of milk
with a crash to the ground.</p>

<p>"Pappina gone!" She stood speechless and
terrified. Recovering herself, she ran through
the bushes, crying: "Pappina, Pappina, Pappina!
Where are you, <i>carina?</i>"</p>

<p>No answer came to her cries.</p>

<p>"Oh, what shall I do? What shall I do?"
she moaned as she ran to and fro, wringing her
hands. "What will Guiseppe say? How can I
tell him Pappina is gone? He'll say it is all my
fault. How can I endure his rage and disappointment?
And my Pappina!&mdash;oh, I should not care
for Guiseppe's anger if I knew she was safe."</p>

<p>Poor Marta! For the first time in years she
gave way to tears. Her whole frame shook with
sobs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>Guiseppe, meanwhile, having finished his meal,
was growing impatient at Marta's delay. The
streets were filling with people.</p>

<p>"What detains them?" he asked himself.
Then the thought occurred to him that perhaps
Marta's warning had come true and the child was
sick again. "God forbid that she is ill!" the man
ejaculated as he piously crossed himself.</p>

<p>He heard the sound of the bugle calling the
soldiers for drill. Priests and children were assembling
for the march into church. Women and
men in festival garb were hastening to mass.
Bands, boys, and venders were everywhere.
Guiseppe paced impatiently up and down, growing
more nervous every moment. Then another
thought came to him:</p>

<p>"Perhaps they've forgotten I'm waiting. Marta
may have forgotten. She's getting to be a bigger
fool every day over that headstrong child. Well,
the minx certainly has grit, and such spirit!
<i>Per bacco!</i> She's lamb and tigress combined.
If she were like other children I could beat her,
but&mdash;well, I'll be hanged if I could beat Pappina!"</p>

<p>Guiseppe's anxiety was increasing every second.
"The crowds are even now going to mass,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
he muttered. "I'll go and meet them." He
started with rapid strides toward the spot where
the three of them had spent the night. He
halted on hearing Marta's sobs. A great fear
overcame him; then, recovering himself, he rushed
on like a madman toward the tree where Marta
sat, sobbing in her grief and fear. He took in the
situation at once.</p>

<p>"What!" he exclaimed, "Pappina not here!
Where is she?"</p>

<p>He stood dazed. The calamity of losing
Pappina on fete day crushed him. Then, arousing
himself, he shook Marta roughly by the shoulder
and showered imprecations upon her.</p>

<p>"You fool! You dog! And to&ndash;day is fete day.
You're in league with the little imp against me."</p>

<p>"Oh, Guiseppe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't speak to me! I humored you, and
what do I get in return? You rob me of my
living. Thief! Snake!" In his anger he kicked
over the Punchinello box. "And I've only these
poor puppets left," he cried.</p>

<p>"Guiseppe, have pity!" Marta begged, shrinking
as far away from him as she could. "The
crowd may be great, but we shall find her. I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
rest neither night nor day till we have found
Pappina."</p>

<p>In the meantime Pappina had darted through
different lanes and streets seeking the center of
the town, but such a little girl could not find her
way about alone, and her freedom began to
frighten her. Also, she was growing very hungry,
for she had had no breakfast.</p>

<p>Just as she was beginning to be sorry she
had not Marta to turn to in time of need, she
saw a milk&ndash;seller milking her cow in front of
a house.</p>

<p>The milk&ndash;sellers in Italy, especially in small
towns, use their cows as milk wagons. They
halt the animals before the doors of their customers,
and milk what the purchasers want.</p>

<p>Pappina approached the rosy&ndash;cheeked woman
who sat milking.</p>

<p>"I am hungry," she said, eyeing the milk
wistfully. "If I sing for you, will you give me
a drink of milk?"</p>

<p>The  milk&ndash;vender  had  many  children  of  her
own. She looked kindly into Pappina's eager,
flushed face as she replied:</p>

<p>"You need not sing to earn the milk. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
Betty's milk is sold, but she will give an extra
glass for a hungry little girl; won't you, Betty?"
She stroked her cow as she spoke.</p>

<p>Pappina drank the milk, sang a little song, and,
refreshed, moved happily on.</p>

<p>"First I will go to mass," she promised herself
as she pursued her way. "Then the crowd will
fill my tambourine and I can go home to my
mother. Oh, I want so to see them all!"</p>

<p>In her confusion she retraced her steps.
Suddenly she caught sight of Guiseppe, who was
gesticulating wildly.</p>

<p>"Oh," she cried, "I hate him! Perhaps he
remembered that it is fete day and went back
for me. I won't let him find me. I must run
and hide."</p>

<p>She turned and fled, looking back occasionally
to see if she had been followed.</p>

<p>It is impossible to tell where or how long she
would have run, had not her attention been
attracted to a strangely dressed man. He was
clad in a long robe of sackcloth, and around his
waist was a girdle of rope from which hung a
wooden cross. A crown of thorns was on his head
and a heavy cross was strapped to his back. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
carried a bundle from which he took little crosses
now and then. These crosses he nailed to every
door where no one objected&mdash;a warning lest the
gayeties of the fete celebration should make
people forget the welfare of their souls.</p>

<p>Pappina was so absorbed in watching him that
she did not notice Marta's approach.</p>

<p>"<i>Carina, carina!</i>" the woman cried, clasping
the child to her.</p>

<p>Pappina began to cry.</p>

<p>"I don't want to go back to Guiseppe," she
sobbed. "I love you, Marta, but I hate Guiseppe.
If you take me back he'll try to beat me."</p>

<p>It took Marta some time to calm Pappina, to
make her understand that it was all a mistake
that she had been (as she thought) deserted.</p>

<p>"Look at my eyes, <i>carina</i>. Are they not still
red from weeping? There is no happiness for
me away from the little one who holds my
heart."</p>

<p>They went to join Guiseppe and the throng
moving to the church. As they approached the
showman, Pappina clung tightly to Marta's hand;
her steps grew slower. She looked into Marta's
face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>"Must we go to him?" she asked plaintively.
"He looks so cross, Marta."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, we must go, but you must not fear.
Guiseppe will be glad to have you back."</p>

<p>Being thus reassured, Pappina smiled at
Guiseppe as he came to meet them, but her smile
was met by a cold stare from the man.</p>

<p>"So you found her," he said curtly to Marta.
"It is well for you both. Come on."</p>

<p>"I know I shall always hate Guiseppe,"
Pappina said softly to Marta. "If he's bad to me
I won't sing."</p>

<p>All along the way to church they passed booths
filled with tempting viands. When Pappina
caught sight of a fine big pig hanging on a stick
she stopped.</p>

<p>"Guiseppe, I'm starved for a piece of pig."</p>

<p>Guiseppe scowled. "I've already had trouble
enough with you for one day," he said. "You
are here to sing, to dance, to earn money; do you
hear? Come at once."</p>

<p>"Yes, Guiseppe, I hear you, but you know I
can't sing when I'm hungry. I do no better than
your puppets. You said so yourself."</p>

<p>She waited a moment for his reply. He made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
none. Lifting her dark eyes, Pappina looked
pleadingly into Guiseppe's face.</p>

<p>"Buy me some," she begged. "I'll sing,
then, the very best I can. Won't you, please,
Guiseppe?"</p>

<p>Guiseppe was in no mood for trifling. He
stretched forth his hand and took Pappina roughly
by the arm. As they started to leave the booth
the vender called: "<i>Un soldo! Un soldo!</i>" The
child stopped.</p>

<p>"Guiseppe, do you hear? Only a penny."</p>

<p>"<i>Un soldo! Un soldo!</i>" again cried the vender.</p>

<p>"Only a <i>soldo</i>, dear Guiseppe," Pappina
pleaded, "and I do so want some! Let me sing
for some."</p>

<p>"Stop now and sing for a half&ndash;penny's worth
of pig! Simpleton! If you must have some,
here&mdash;" He took a <i>soldo</i> from his money&ndash;bag.
So Pappina got her piece of pig.</p>

<p>Guiseppe, Marta and Pappina joined the worshipers,
leaving before mass was over in order
to find a good place in which to begin the Punchinello
show as soon as the throng had finished its
devotions.</p>

<p>As the people began to leave the church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
Guiseppe started the show. One play was over
by the time the priests, bearing bright banners,
had marched from the sanctuary. Guiseppe was
preparing to begin the second play when Pappina
sprang suddenly to his side.</p>

<p>"Stop, Guiseppe, I beg you! Let me sing for
them."  She pointed to the hundred children
dressed in white who were marching out of the
church. Without waiting for permission to sing
Pappina laid her tambourine on her breast,
clasped her hands over it as if in prayer, raised
heavenward her eyes and sang:</p>

<p>"<i>Ave Maria, gratia plena.</i>"</p>

<p>As though an angel's voice had reached them,
the priests and children halted in their march,
the motley crowd stood spellbound with bowed
heads. Even Guiseppe, after his first surprise,
crossed himself. The tears were streaming down
Marta's face.</p>

<p>"<i>Ave Maria, gratia plena.</i>" Clear and sweet
rang the child's voice. "<i>Ave Maria</i>, Amen."</p>

<p>From the lips of the priests and the white&ndash;robed
children came spontaneously in response,
"Amen," and the crowd gathered about the
diminutive singer murmured softly, "Amen."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>For a moment there was a deep silence,
then one by one, as though moving to an altar,
those who had listened to her singing, almost
reverently deposited their offerings in Pappina's
tambourine.</p>

<p>The spirit of devotion awakened on the street,
made it seem almost a sacrilege to continue with
the Punchinellos.</p>

<p>The music of drums and fifes came faintly
from the distance. Nearer and nearer the slender
<i>carabinieri</i> approached, the silver trimmings on
their black uniforms glistening in the sun. On
horseback and on foot they came, and passed.
Round the corner with rapid tramp came the
<i>bersaglieri</i> (sharpshooters). They drew up in
two lines and executed with precision the orders of
their lieutenant, the cock's plumes on their stiff
black hats fluttering in the light breeze. Confetti,
serpentine, even bon&ndash;bons, were thrown about
in profusion.</p>

<p>So began fete day in Cava, and so it passed
as other fete days throughout the land of Italy,
differing from them only in the gloriously beautiful
illuminated cross at the very summit of Monte
Castello. On the peak of this mountain lives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the "Hermit of Monte Castello." Each year
he begs funds sufficient to illuminate grandly his
mountain home on fete day.</p><br />

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">The Bersaglieri</p>

<p class="p1">Guiseppe had kept Pappina singing and dancing
all day, till it would seem her throat and feet
must surely both give out. Marta dared not
interfere. "Will the day never end?" she kept
asking herself. She rejoiced when the festivities
began to wane, when the streets became deserted,
when one by one the lights went out.</p>

<p>"Well," said Guiseppe, looking about him,
"seems as if every one but us has gone. I suppose
we shall have to get along and find a place to
sleep."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is there not money enough&mdash;can we not
afford to remain in Cava over night, to have beds?"
Marta timidly asked. "The ground is so hard
for the child," she added.</p>

<p>"Marta, you have less sense every day," was
Guiseppe's angry reply. "Bed for the child,
eh? Next thing you'll be wanting me to carry
around a cradle for her to sleep in. You'll want
her to ride in a carriage. Aren't the nights warm
and pleasant? The ground is good enough for
me to sleep on; it's good enough for you; and it's
good enough for the child."</p>

<p>Marta made no further appeal, but taking
Pappina in her arms carried her where Guiseppe
led.</p>

<p>"I've had a happy day. Oh, I liked the lights,
the music and the people, but I'm so tired,"
Pappina told Marta as she laid her head on her
improvised pillow and went at once to sleep.</p>

<p>Guiseppe took out his greasy pouch, and
chuckled as he counted time and again his gains.</p>

<p>"It's been a good day, Marta, the best I've
ever had. <i>Per bacco</i>, how she sang the Ave Maria!
A good day." He patted his money bag. "A
good day. Good&ndash;night, Marta."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>Guiseppe, too, was soon asleep. And Marta?
She shared neither Guiseppe's joy nor Pappina's
happiness. She longed to be back in Naples, to
take the child away from the applauding public.
She kept saying to herself:</p>

<p>"It's a crime to make her the object of so much
attention. It may spoil her, ruin her. What can
I do? If only together we might run away to
England, to America!"</p>

<p>In her fear of Guiseppe even the thought
frightened her. She hated her weakness in not
refusing to let the child continue such a life.
Years of servitude to her tyrannical husband
had made her afraid to express any wish or will
of her own.</p>

<p>"I will pray," she said softly. "I will ask
God to save my baby Pappina from this strain,
these hardships, and the wrong we are doing
her."</p>

<p>She knelt by Pappina's side. Taking one of the
child's hands in hers, she prayed fervently for
God's blessing on the little one and for the realization
of her heart's desire&mdash;to see Pappina free
from Guiseppe's selfish tyranny.</p>

<p>Because of her great faith in prayer, a peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
stole upon her, a confidence that Pappina would
be protected and liberated in some way best
for all.</p>

<p>"We  will wait," she murmured to herself.
"A prevision will be made. We will wait."</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="pn center slarge"><span class="smcap">Hardships at Salerno</span></p>

<p class="pn p2">Guiseppe was barely awake on the morning
after the fete when he took out his money&ndash;bag
to recount his gains.</p>

<p>"I'll sell these old puppets," he said to himself.
"What do the few <i>soldi</i> they bring in
amount to, compared with Pappina? If the minx
only remains as bewitching as she is now, I'll
not complain. Hang it all! Why can't every
day be fete day!"</p>

<p>He glanced at the child, curled up on the
ground, asleep.</p>

<p>"I may as well let her rest. It isn't much of
a trip to Salerno, and I don't suppose it matters
much when we get there; nothing special on hand
there that I know of. I hope we'll find plenty of
foreigners everywhere we go. They appreciate
Pappina."</p>

<p>Guiseppe filled his pipe and as he smoked he
wove a bright dream of wealth. Happy thought!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
He smiled broadly and joyfully rubbed his hands
together.</p>

<p>"I'll take her to America!" he chuckled to
himself. "Why not? The Punchinellos too!"
His countenance fell. "No, no," he muttered, "I
can't talk in English for the puppets. How, how
am I to manage that?"</p>

<p>He became so absorbed in his thoughts that
he forgot the pipe he was smoking. It dropped
from his mouth as he exclaimed gleefully:</p>

<p>"Aha! I have it! A hand&ndash;organ in America
with my beautiful Pappina! She'll make our
fortune."</p>

<p>He picked up his pipe and jumped quickly
to his feet, calling to Marta.</p>

<p>"Get up, Marta, and wake the beauty! Up,
I say! Let's be off. Make haste, Marta. We'll
soon be rich; do you hear?"</p>

<p>Pappina, hearing his loud call, sprang up at
once. She rubbed her eyes, trying to make sure
she was awake.</p>

<p>"Was I dreaming, Guiseppe, or did you&mdash;did I
really hear you say we'll soon be rich?" she asked.</p>

<p>Guiseppe hesitated a moment before replying:
"<i>Si, si, carina.</i> If you'll always sing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
dance as you did yesterday, we will go to America
where there is no end of money."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd like that!" and Pappina clapped her
hands.</p>

<p>Something in her movements reminded
Guiseppe of a song he used to sing.</p>

<p>"Come, girl," he said cheerfully, "here's a
song&mdash;a new one that just suits you. Funny I
never thought of it before! Listen, my beauty,
and see how quickly you can learn it. It will
bring gold, and gold brings everything. It will
take us across the ocean to America. Come&mdash;stand
up&mdash;so!"</p>

<p>Pappina needed no second bidding. She took
her position opposite Guiseppe, alert to follow
every tone, word, and gesture. Many times the
man stopped to laugh at and applaud Pappina
for her wonderful aptness, and his praises made
her more keen to imitate him perfectly.</p>

<p>The child's dark hair hung in disorder about
her animated face, her great black eyes were
aglow as she sang, danced and recited, going over
the song again and again, she and Guiseppe both
so interested that neither realized the flight of
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>Marta dared not interrupt them. She watched
Pappina with pain in her heart, saying almost
continually to herself:</p>

<p>"<i>Grand dio! Quando, quando</i> [Great God!
When, when]?"</p>

<p>Gold! Riches! They meant nothing to her.
Her one desire was to see Pappina liberated from
this life she felt sure would destroy her health,
innocence, and beauty.</p>

<p>Hark! "<i>Le parlete d'amore</i>," that beautiful
air from "Faust," came floating to their ears. The
fresh, clear voice rang through the morning air.</p>

<p>"<i>Odi, chi e</i> [Listen, who is it]?" Pappina exclaimed,
peering down the winding road. A young
girl came around a bend, leading a small pig, and
the child darted toward her. A few yards from
the singer she paused, uncertain whether to continue
or not, but being reassured by a bright smile
from the girl, she hastened on. Reaching the
maiden, she stopped, and looked wonderingly at
the pig.</p>

<p>"What is it you have?" she asked timidly,
for it is only in the country that girls have pet
pigs, and Pappina had never seen one.</p>

<p>"What have I? Why, don't you know, little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
one? It is my pet pig." The young girl laid her
hand caressingly on the animal's head as she
spoke.</p>

<p>Tender little Pappina had never in her short
life had anything to pet, not even a doll. She
took hold of the ribbon around the pig's neck.</p>

<p>"How pretty!" she exclaimed. "He won't
hurt me, will he? What's his name?"</p>

<p>"I named him Savio, because he is so wise."</p>

<p>"Isn't he beautiful! May I pet him?"</p>

<p>Pappina had not waited for permission, but
was patting the pig's head. As she stroked his
bristles she prattled to the girl.</p>

<p>"You see," she said confidingly, "we are poor
now, but we are going to America, and we are
going to get rich. Guiseppe said so this very
morning. When we come back I want to buy
Savio. You'll let me have him, won't you?
I'll be good to him. I'll buy him a new ribbon
every day, and a necklace, too&mdash;that is, if there's
money enough," she added thoughtfully.</p>

<p>The girl, Susanna, laughed heartily as she
replied:</p>

<p>"When you come back from America, you shall
have my dear Savio. Now I must be going.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
Good&ndash;by." She waved her hand to Pappina as
she moved on.</p>

<p>Guiseppe and Marta stood watching Pappina
with amusement, but as she started to follow
Susanna and Savio, Guiseppe called: "Pappina,
Pappina."</p>

<p>Pappina either did not or would not hear.
Louder and louder Guiseppe shouted her name.
Susanna stopped.</p>

<p>"Is it not you he calls?" she asked. "Are
you not Pappina?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, but I want to walk just a little way
with you and Savio. You'll let me, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Pappina!" Guiseppe's voice sounded harsh
and angry.</p>

<p>"You had better go back, little one. <i>Addio.</i>"</p>

<p>For a moment Pappina stood looking after
Susanna, then with a burst of song turned and
ran back to Marta and Guiseppe. She did not heed
Guiseppe's scowl, but smiled into his face.</p>

<p>"Guiseppe," she cried, "I must learn the new
song at once. I want to earn lots of money, so
we can go to America, and get rich, and have pet
pigs. Wasn't he just beautiful? His name is
Savio, and she says I may have him when we come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
back from America. Oh, you don't know how
much I want a pig like Savio!"</p>

<p>Guiseppe could not help smiling at Pappina's
prattle. He put his hand under her chin and lifting
her radiant little face toward his, he teasingly
asked:</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you rather have Savio cooked like
the piece of pig you had at Cava? <i>Ebbene!</i>
Now for the song. Where did we stop?"</p>

<p>"I have been thinking," Marta timidly interrupted,
"that perhaps, if we are going to America,
and if&mdash;if you both wish me to do so, I could teach
Pappina an English song." She glanced at
Guiseppe as though fearful he might laugh at the
idea, but to her relief he looked pleased.</p>

<p>"How about it, little one?" he asked, turning
to Pappina. "Would you like to learn to sing
an English song?"</p>

<p>Pappina always showed her greatest delight
by clapping her hands. She clapped them now.</p>

<p>"<i>Che gioia</i> [What joy]!" she cried. "Oh,
Guiseppe, let me learn it now, this very minute!
won't you please, Guiseppe? Because you know
we are sure to need it in America. Come, quickly,
Marta."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>Marta grew nervous.</p>

<p>"I cannot sing," she cried, "I have no music
in my voice, but I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind your voice! Pappina will do
the singing. Are you both ready? Then why
don't you begin?" Guiseppe spoke impatiently.</p>

<p>Marta tremblingly began. The words were
barely out of her mouth when Pappina repeated
them eagerly, but always with an "ah" at the end
making them all like Italian words. Marta
smiled at the pronunciation, but Guiseppe was
delighted.</p>

<p>"Bravo, bravo!" he cried. "Teach it well,
Marta! She can sing it here for all the English
and Americans we meet. It will charm them to
hear her sing in their own tongue; it will mean
money, and it's money that will take us to America."</p>

<p>Childlike, Pappina soon grew tired of trying to
learn the song. She wanted to be journeying on
to new people, sights, and scenes. Guiseppe, too,
became impatient to be off in quest of that which
would take them to "the land of money," as he
called America again and again.</p>

<p>He was walking, as usual, with bowed head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
his eyes on the ground, when he suddenly sprang
to the side of the road and with the toe of his boot
pushed back the dry grass that was partially concealing
a string of gold beads. He picked them up.</p>

<p>"Aha!" he cried, holding them up for view,
"they are gold! Luck is with us. Gold! I can
sell them." He put them into a pocket of his
coat.</p>

<p>"Guiseppe, I want them. Give them to me."
Pappina dug her little sun&ndash;browned hand into his
pocket and brought up the bright beads. Guiseppe
snatched them from her. Pappina stamped her
foot. "Guiseppe, I want those beads!"</p>

<p>"You can't have them."</p>

<p>"Guiseppe, give them to me! Please, dear
Guiseppe!"</p>

<p>She begged, threatened and cried, but all in
vain.</p>

<p>"Enough, enough, I say! Come on," Guiseppe
commanded, as he started forward.</p>

<p>"I'll not stir till you give me those beads,"
the child declared.</p>

<p>Guiseppe came back to her and raised his hand
threateningly, but stubborn Pappina declared
again:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll not sing for you ever, Guiseppe, if you
keep those pretty beads. I'll never, never sing
for you again, and then we can never go to America.
I'd sooner give up the pet pig than those gold
beads."</p>

<p>Marta grew bold. "Oh, please let her have
them," she pleaded.</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue!" her husband answered
roughly. "You'd have me give her my head if
she asked for it."</p>

<p>Guiseppe again lifted his hand threateningly
and had started toward Pappina when a carriage
drove up. The merry party in it&mdash;foreigners on
their way from Cava to Salerno&mdash;had already
noted his menacing air, Marta's pained look,
and the beautiful child pouting by the wayside.</p>

<p>They stopped. Only Marta understood their
English words.</p>

<p>"Poor little thing, she looks ready to cry. Do
find out about them," begged one of the ladies of
the party.</p>

<p>"Do you understand English?" her husband
asked Guiseppe.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Marta answered for her husband.</p>

<p>"What have you to entertain us?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>"We have the Punchinellos, and we have the
child, who sings and dances."</p>

<p>"We had enough of the Punchinellos in Naples.
Let the little girl give us a song," cried an Englishman,
taking a coin from his pocket. Others did
the same. "A song, a song!" they cried.</p>

<p>Marta translated to Guiseppe.</p>

<p>"Pappina, sing," he commanded.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Guiseppe felt an anger he dared not show.</p>

<p>"Pappina, sing for America," he begged.</p>

<p>The obstinate little girl shook her head.</p>

<p>"I told you, Guiseppe," she answered, "I'll
never sing till you give me those beads."</p>

<p>Guiseppe stood for a moment with his hand on
the beads, irresolute. He heard the jingle of
coins waiting to be paid for the song.</p>

<p>Pappina was quick to notice that his hand was
in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Guiseppe, won't you give me the beads?"
she pleaded. "I want them so much. Please,
dear Guiseppe!"</p>

<p>She stretched out her hand for them just as
the gentleman who was driving took up the lines
to continue the drive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Stop, we are ready," cried Guiseppe, handing
the beads to Pappina. She fastened the string
around her neck, took up her tambourine, and
sang.</p>

<p>True little Neapolitan, in her delight over the
new necklace she sang and danced with such
spirit that even Guiseppe was surprised. The
tourists, having paid well for Pappina's songs,
went on their way.</p>

<p>"That pretty lady in blue," said Marta as the
travelers departed, "was wondering if we treat
you well, Pappina. She said she wished she
could speak Italian and find out if you are our
own child, and if you are happy in your life, or
only singing to keep from being beaten, as so many
little singers have to do."</p>

<p>Pappina laughed merrily.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell her that I always love
you, Marta?" she cried. "And sometimes I love
Guiseppe."</p>

<p>She went to Guiseppe and reaching up on her
tiptoes, patted his cheek.</p>

<p>"<i>Caro</i> Guiseppe," she said, "I love you to&ndash;day
because you gave me the beads. Perhaps to&ndash;morrow
I shall hate you, and&mdash;really, Guiseppe&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
can't help it. Sometimes you're so mean I
could kill you, but to&ndash;day, Guiseppe," fondling
her beads, "I love you almost as well as I do
Marta."</p>

<p>Pappina's words and little caress pleased
Guiseppe, but he let neither her nor Marta see
his pleasure. He took up the Punchinellos,
merely saying: "I guess we'll be moving."</p>

<p>It was a happy little group that continued its
way toward Salerno. Pappina took off her beads
every few minutes to admire them.</p>

<p>"How good you are, Guiseppe!" she repeatedly
said to him. Her happiness brought a smile to
Guiseppe's hard face.</p>

<p>Marta likened her to a humming&ndash;bird, as she
flitted in song from flower to flower, plucking
first one for Marta, then one for Guiseppe.</p>

<p>Pappina was too full of life and joy to&ndash;day to
plod along with Marta behind Guiseppe. She
kept running ahead of the two. Something unusual
attracted her notice and as she did not have
the patience to stand and wait for them, she ran
back to meet them, exclaiming as she seized their
hands:</p>

<p>"Hurry! There's the cutest little church down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
the  road. Come quickly! We must all pray."</p>

<p>"It's a wayside shrine," Marta told her.</p>

<p>"Not a church? Then can't we go there
and pray?" Pappina said with a disappointed
look.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear. Everywhere through this country
we find these shrines. They are built for just such
wanderers as we, that we may always remember
to pray."</p>

<p>"There's a light. See, Marta."</p>

<p>"There is always a candle or a little lamp
burning at the altar, where we pray to either a
picture or a statuette of the Madonna."</p>

<p>By this time they were at the entrance.
Pappina turned to Guiseppe and took his hand.</p>

<p>"If you hadn't given me the beads," she said,
"I shouldn't want to pray."</p>

<p>After their devotions were over the three
continued their journey to Salerno, so prettily
situated in a cozy little corner of Salerno Bay,
and backed by gigantic mountains which remind
one of a father protecting his child. They
walked into the town, down the narrow, irregular
streets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>As they paused at a corner Pappina struck her
tambourine, ready to start her song.</p>

<p>"No, no, not yet, little one," Guiseppe said.
"This is not the place for you. You and Marta
sit down and wait for me here. I'll look about a
bit and find out what is going on in the town."</p>

<p>They watched him as he walked briskly down
the street. Once he looked back and waved his
hand to Pappina, who in turn threw him a kiss.</p>

<p>"I just love Guiseppe when he is good!" cried
the child. "I hope he won't be gone long,"
she added, as her eyes followed his retreating
figure.</p>

<p>Stern and forbidding as Guiseppe usually
looked, when he wished to be agreeable he had an
air that charmed all whom he met. He had bright
stories at his command and could tell them as
became a man of his former calling. To&ndash;day
he chose to be a hail fellow well met as he walked
about Salerno seeking information that would
lead to his financial interest.</p>

<p>By chance he met an old friend from Naples.</p>

<p>"Aha, Guiseppe Capasso!" the man cried.
"What good fate leads me to you, or you to me,
as it may be?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>"The luck is mine, signor," with a hearty
hand&ndash;shake Guiseppe replied. "Out of Naples,
where I was born and bred, I feel indeed a stranger
in a strange land."</p>

<p>"Come, Guiseppe, let's celebrate our fortunate
meeting. A game or two&mdash;what do you say, my
friend?"</p>

<p>Together they visited a wine shop and there
they drank and gambled at "Mora." Guiseppe
lost.</p>

<p>"I'll drink and forget," he cried. So he went
from one wine shop to another, drinking, losing,
cursing his losses, drinking again to forget his
ill&ndash;luck.</p>

<p>When Marta saw him coming toward herself
and Pappina, she knew at once what the trouble
was. She knew also that too much wine put him
in an ugly mood. She placed her arm about
Pappina and kissed her brow.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>carissima</i>," she whispered, "if you love
me, be patient with Guiseppe! He may abuse you,
but remember that I love you."</p>

<p>Even before Marta had finished, Guiseppe was
speaking.</p>

<p>"There's no fete day here till September, St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
Matthew's Day," he said. Turning to Pappina,
he continued: "Look here, girl, we are going
where there will be a crowd of people promenading
to&ndash;night. We are going to the Quay&mdash;they call
it Corso Garibaldi. I'll have none of your impudence
in that crowd to&ndash;night&mdash;none of your
stubbornness; do you understand? When I say
sing, you will sing. When I say dance, you will
dance. Do you hear?"</p>

<p>"<i>Si</i>, signor," came faintly from Pappina's
white lips. As she spoke she glanced at Marta,
stifling her anger for the sake of the woman she
loved.</p>

<p>"Then remember." He shook his fist in her
face. She flushed scarlet, but said nothing. Guiseppe
evidently was expecting a reply. He waited
a moment, then continued his tirade: "Why don't
you speak, girl? You stand there, red in the face,
ready to kill me, and say nothing. Have out
with it; what you've got to say I want to hear
right now. I'll have none of your impudence
to&ndash;night."</p>

<p>There was no reply from the child, who stood
looking in amazement at Guiseppe, as she tightly
held Marta's bony hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, afraid of me for once, are you?" he
sneered. "Marta, the minx is afraid of me.
Bravo! Bravo! I'll drink to her health as soon
as we find a wine&ndash;shop. Ha, ha, Marta! She's
a coward, after all."</p>

<p>He stooped to pick up a coin he had dropped.
Pappina, unable longer to control herself, sprang
at him in a furious rage. She gave him one
fierce slap across the cheek. With a cry of pain,
he turned on the child. Marta caught hold of him.</p>

<p>"Guiseppe, Guiseppe," she cried, "you'll lose
her if you strike her."</p>

<p>Still he attempted to reach Pappina, blind in
his drunken fury. Marta held him with an iron
grip.</p>

<p>"Don't!" she screamed. "Don't! You shan't!
She'll run away. Stop, Guiseppe! You know
you can't strike her and keep her."</p>

<p>Guiseppe shook Marta fiercely. Her sparse
brown locks loosened and fell about her livid
face, but still she held him, and the drunken man
was no match for her. He struggled to break
away, but Marta seemed to possess superhuman
strength. Her grip on his arm was so strong that
it pained him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let go, you fiend!" he cried.</p>

<p>"Never, Guiseppe, till you promise you will
not harm her. She is only a child."</p>

<p>"You hurt me! Let go, I say!"</p>

<p>"Then promise."</p>

<p>"Fiend, let go! I promise."</p>

<p>Guiseppe broke away from Marta. He glared
at  Pappina, who stood facing him defiantly
her head thrown back, her eyes blazing, her arms
folded.</p>

<p>"You little vixen!" Guiseppe shouted, "I'll
make you rue this day! You shall pay dearly
for this!" Smothering his anger, he took up the
Punchinellos. "Come," he commanded, "we will
play to the crowds&mdash;all night, if I will it. Come
on, I say."</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="pn center slarge"><span class="smcap">Another Reconciliation</span></p>

<p class="pn p2">Guiseppe, his cheek still smarting from Pappina's
blow, strode along toward the Quay and its
beautiful walk, Corso Garibaldi.</p>

<p>In spite of his intoxication, Guiseppe was conscious
of a new respect for Marta, awakened by
her fearless defence of the child she loved.</p>

<p>"They are both against me," he muttered.
"Marta&mdash;staid, timid Marta&mdash;she becomes a lioness
when she fights for Pappina. Who would believe
it? But she is right, Marta's right. I can't
beat the minx and keep her. They are two
against me, two against me."</p>

<p>Time and again he turned his head and glared
fiercely from under his shaggy eyebrows at Pappina,
and without his usual bullying look at Marta.
His gaze was met unflinchingly by both, who,
as he said, seemed banded against him.</p>

<p>Pappina  would not admit, even to herself,
that she was afraid of Guiseppe in his drunken,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
quarrelsome condition, but Marta noticed that the
little hand in hers trembled and held her own more
tightly whenever Guiseppe turned toward them.</p>

<p>Worn and tired from the long tramp, Pappina
inquired of Marta: "Where is he going? I can't
walk much farther. I feel weak, Marta."</p>

<p>"<i>Poverina</i> [poor little one], I do not know,
but we are together and you are safe with me,"
Marta replied as they followed Guiseppe through
the merry crowd that was enjoying the pleasures
of the walk and the beauties of the moonlit bay.</p>

<p>When he reached the theater, he stopped and
put down the Punchinellos. Assuming a bravado
air, he ordered Pappina to sing.</p>

<p>"You remember what I said?" he asked.
"You shall sing all night if I will it so. Marta
knows me. She can tell you that I say what I
mean and mean what I say. It is not the Punchinellos
to&ndash;night, it is you." He shook his fist in
Pappina's face.</p>

<p>Rebellious, tired, and hungry, she quickly
lifted her clenched fist to strike again, but Marta
enfolded the little doubled&ndash;up hand in hers.</p>

<p>"It is best to obey to&ndash;night," she whispered.
"Sing for me, my bird, for I love you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>Marta's loving words appealed to Pappina as
nothing else would have done. She rose quickly
and sang the best she could. The poor little girl
put no animation in the vivacious song she tried
to sing; it might have passed for a funeral dirge.</p>

<p>After the long tramp it was hard for the child
to stand and sing; to dance was impossible.
There was a plaintiveness in her voice and in her
manner. She was but a baby, forced beyond
her strength; made to sing for her food.</p>

<p>Her face looked drawn and white, even her
lips were colorless. At times her voice could
scarcely be heard. When she staggered in her
efforts to dance, as she did many times, she looked
helplessly and appealingly at Marta.</p>

<p>Guiseppe's eyes were on the crowd only. He
noticed their interest in the singer, and nothing
more. When Pappina finished the song, he
shouted: "Give! Give! Here, little one, pass
your tambourine."</p>

<p>Marta knew and the people knew. The tambourine
was passed.</p>

<p>"Fill, so the brute will take her home." Only
Marta of our three wanderers understood these
words, spoken in English.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>Guiseppe quickly took possession of the money.
"I am thirsty. Wine, wine!" he exclaimed,
"I must have wine. Who wouldn't drink, with
her&mdash;" He pointed to Pappina and left the sentence
unfinished. "Wait for me here, and don't
move or I'll kill you both."</p>

<p>He was out of sight in a moment, disappearing
into a wine shop. They heard his boisterous
laugh within. Marta took Pappina's hand in hers.</p>

<p>"<i>Carissima</i>," she said, "you are so hungry
and so tired! Guiseppe is not himself. He
forgets."</p>

<p>A new light shone in Pappina's eyes. She
was given new strength. This time she would
sing, not from fear of Guiseppe, perhaps not from
love of Marta. She was just a worn&ndash;out, tired
little child whose tender age should have ensured
her protection at home&mdash;only seven years old,
but forced to battle with the world, seeking
refuge through her songs from storms and hunger,
a weatherbeaten bird. For her there was now
no place called home, no place to lay her tired
little head. She knew that to sing and dance
meant money, and that she and Marta were hungry
and in need of money for supper. She took her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
tambourine from Marta, threw it high in the air,
caught it, and began to dance.</p>

<p>The gaping crowd that had watched her efforts
before stood almost aghast as she swayed and
tipped and toed, till one would have thought her
little feet would refuse to take another step.
Then, pausing a moment to take breath, she
started to sing the rollicking song Guiseppe had
just taught her&mdash;with gestures and grimaces,
stopping to speak, dashing into song, now laughing
so infectiously that every bystander joined
with her.</p>

<p>She finished the song in an uproar of laughter,
applause, and shouts of "Bravo, bravo!"</p>

<p>The  enthusiastic listeners fairly threw <i>soldi</i>
at her. Pappina wanted them for supper for Marta
and herself. They had tramped all day with but a
bite of bread in the early morning. Pappina's
haggard little face glowed with pleasure as she
took the well&ndash;filled tambourine to Marta.</p>

<p>"See, Marta, yours to&ndash;night&mdash;not Guiseppe's&mdash;yours!"</p>

<p>"No, not mine; it is yours alone, <i>carissima</i>."</p>

<p>"Then it is yours and mine.  Come, let's go.
Macaroni, Marta! Hurry, dear Marta."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pappina, <i>mia carissima</i>, Pappina!" Marta
walked a few steps then stopped. "Should
Guiseppe return and find us gone!" Even as she
spoke she did not feel her usual fear.</p>

<p>"But I am starved, Marta. I must eat, unless,
dear, good Marta, you who love me say I mustn't."</p>

<p>Marta hesitated for a moment, looking down
the street to see if her husband was returning.
He was nowhere in sight. Her love for Pappina
conquered her fear of Guiseppe's displeasure.</p>

<p>"Wait for me here," she said. "I will go and
bring us food."</p>

<p>With all haste it was purchased and eaten.
It was long after they had finished their simple
meal that Guiseppe returned from his revelry.</p>

<p>His mood was changed. He had drank so
much wine he could scarcely stand up. He loved
the little girl who had filled his purse. He laid
his hand caressingly on her head. She shuddered
at his touch, and clung close to Marta, who looked
fearlessly into Guiseppe's face and said sternly:</p>

<p>"I am used to your thoughtlessness, used even
to cruelty; but Pappina is worn out, and she must
have her rest."</p>

<p>"Eh! What's that you say? She's tired?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Macaroni and a bottle of wine will build her up.
Come on, sweet one." Stretching out his hand to
Pappina, he continued: "Throughout the town
those who have seen you and heard you to&ndash;night
sing your praises. They believe you are mine.
<i>Ebbene!</i> So you are, sweet one&mdash;so you are."</p>

<p>"Guiseppe," and Pappina looked pleadingly
into his half&ndash;closed eyes, "Guiseppe, if you love
me so much, take me where we shall sleep to&ndash;night.
I'm not hungry, Guiseppe, but I'm so tired. I
want to go to sleep."</p>

<p>Worn out, Pappina began to cry. Marta
quickly gathered the child into her arms and
carried her to a place Guiseppe selected as suitable
to spend the night.</p>

<p class="p2">Sabbath morning! So beautiful it dawned
that it seemed to be wooing man, woman and
child to worship the God who could give to his
children so perfect a day. Flowers, grass, birds and
sky, with the bright Bay of Salerno in the glint
of the morning sun, all attested to the wonders
of a marvelous world with its perfection in every
phase of nature as it appeared this Sunday in
Salerno.</p>

<p>Guiseppe slept in a drunken stupor. Marta
was afraid to speak, even in a whisper, for fear
of disturbing his slumber. Pappina, harboring
a feeling of hatred stronger than ever, grew tired
of waiting for Guiseppe to awaken.</p>

<p>"Marta," she said softly.</p>

<p>"Sh!" Marta raised her finger to silence
Pappina, who for a time sat quiet. Then the
stillness began to irritate her.</p>

<p>"Marta," she began again and once more
Marta tried to silence her, but this time in vain.
"I won't 'sh,' for it must be time to go to church,
and surely he," (pointing to Guiseppe), "ought to
pray."</p>

<p>Guiseppe, hearing her voice, sat up and looked
about him in a dazed way out of his bleary eyes.
Pappina, seeing him thus, needed courage to speak
at all, but with her characteristic fearlessness
she said:</p>

<p>"Come, Guiseppe, it's Sunday. We must go
to church."</p>

<p>"Sunday! Let me sleep. Sunday, did you
say? There's nothing to do on Sunday except
pray. I'll sleep. If you two simpletons want to
pray, go on to church and let me alone. Get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
along, I'll wait." He fell over on the ground and
was soon snoring loudly.</p>

<p>Hand in hand Marta and Pappina walked
away.</p>

<p>"I dared not ask Guiseppe for money. You
saw, <i>carina</i>, he is not yet himself."</p>

<p>Pappina's face was wreathed in smiles as she
stooped down to bring up <i>soldi</i> she had hidden in
her shoe the night before. It was not the cleanest
hand in the world that handed the money to Marta,
but the little grime on it did not prevent Marta
from seizing it and covering it with kisses.</p>

<p>"I am so glad, so glad, <i>carina!</i>" she exclaimed.
"Now you need not go hungry to church."</p>

<p>After a hasty breakfast they were soon in the
celebrated St. Matthew's Cathedral. Marta, fearful
of Guiseppe's displeasure if he were to awaken
and be kept waiting too long, wished to say a
short prayer and return at once, but Pappina
was anxious to follow the people and see the
things that interested them. She suddenly seized
Marta by the arm and almost dragged her out of
the church. There was a look of terror on the
child's face.</p>

<p>"<i>Carina</i>, what is it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>"Those ladies&mdash;you saw them, Marta! The
man with them&mdash;you said he was a guide&mdash;didn't
you hear what he was telling them?" She covered
her face with her hands. "Oh, I cannot bear to
think of it!"</p>

<p>"No, I did not hear. Tell me, what did he
say that frightened you? Perhaps you didn't
understand."</p>

<p>"Oh. I did. I heard every word. He told
them that three saints' heads had been cut off right
by that column where we were standing. It scared
me so that now I am afraid to go back, and I
wanted so much to go to the tomb of the Pope.
The guide said one is buried in the church. You
have seen so much, Marta&mdash;have you ever seen a
Pope's tomb?"</p>

<p>"No, <i>carina</i>, but we must go back now, at once,
to Guiseppe."</p>

<p>"Back to Guiseppe," Pappina repeated slowly,
"back to Guiseppe." She grew thoughtful.
"Marta, must we go back to Guiseppe? May we
not run a way?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my sweet baby, we must&mdash;we must go
back to Guiseppe!"</p>

<p>They met him walking to meet them. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
smiled kindly as they approached him. He even
held out his hand to Pappina, but she paid no
attention to his overture for friendship and
forgiveness.</p>

<p>"Have you  already  said your prayers?" he
asked, looking at Marta.</p>

<p>"Our prayers were short," she replied. "We
thought you would not like to be kept waiting."</p>

<p>"And Pappina! She has no use for Guiseppe
this morning." He took one of her curls in his
hand as he spoke.</p>

<p>"You were bad yesterday, Guiseppe," Pappina
answered with a jerk of her head that snatched
the curl from his hand.</p>

<p>"You are right, <i>bambina</i>, you are right.
Forgive me. Guiseppe was a regular brute yesterday;
wasn't he?" he asked in a tone that seemed
to crave denial from the child.</p>

<p>"You were, Guiseppe," she replied with a
sunny smile as she took hold of his hand, "you
really were; but if you are sorry, I'll forgive you."</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="pn center slarge"><span class="smcap">Along the Coast and in Amalfi</span></p>

<p class="pn p2">They were all sitting on the ground under a
broad spreading tree; Guiseppe was smoking and
Marta teaching Pappina the alphabet. Little
sticks and bits of grass were brought into use
for the construction of the letters.</p>

<p>Pappina was much interested for a while, but
she was altogether too impatient a child to keep
at one thing for any length of time.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I've learned enough for one day,
Marta." With her foot she scattered the letters
to the four winds. Then, turning to Guiseppe,
she asked: "Where are we going next? I want
to go where there are people to sing to."</p>

<p>"You'll find plenty at Amalfi."</p>

<p>"Amalfi? Is that the name of the town we
are going to?" Guiseppe nodded. "Why, I
thought this road was called Amalfi&mdash;something
or other&mdash;what is it, Marta?"</p>

<p>"It is called the Amalfi Coast, but there also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a><br /><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>is a town called Amalfi. That is where we are
going next."</p><br />

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">The Amalfi coast</p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1">Pappina arose, and brushed off the loose grass
clinging to her dress. She stood for a moment
in front of Guiseppe, looking about as though
uncertain what to do with herself. As he smiled
kindly upon her she ventured to ask:</p>

<p>"Come, Guiseppe, aren't you tired of sitting
here so long, just smoking that old pipe? Mayn't
we go now?" Seeing no move on his part, she
added, "Please, Guiseppe," as she stretched out
her hands to assist him to rise.</p>

<p>He playfully blew a cloud of smoke in her face.</p>

<p>"Don't be so impatient, little one," he answered.
"No hurry. Here, Marta, take her
down to the water and show her how to skip
stones."</p>

<p>Joyously Pappina took Marta by the hand
and together they almost ran to the promontory.
It was some time before the child wearied of this
new recreation. Marta, remembering that the
English song was still unlearned, improved this
opportunity to sing it again and again as she
skipped the stones. Soon Pappina was singing
it with her, and the little song was learned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>When Pappina ran back and sang it for Guiseppe,
he laughed heartily, which evidence of good
humor gave Pappina the courage to plead:</p>

<p>"Come, Guiseppe, do! Marta says it is beautiful
along the coast, and that there are great
rocks with the sweetest violet flowers growing out
of them. Come, Guiseppe, I want to pick some
of those flowers."</p>

<p>"But, <i>carina</i>," Marta reminded her, "did I not
tell you that these blossoms live only on the
rocks and die if plucked? Besides, you cannot
reach&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sit down, <i>bambina</i>," interrupted Guiseppe.
"When I finish this pipe, we will trudge along to
Amalfi."</p>

<p>Pappina was reluctant to wait, but she sat
down beside Guiseppe, and amused herself trying
to catch the curls of smoke which he was puffing
from his pipe.</p>

<p>"Hold up your foot, little one." Guiseppe
took up her foot as he spoke. "See, Marta, the
girl has nearly tramped and danced her shoes off.
I suppose that means new ones again, <i>bambina</i>."</p>

<p>It took little kindness to make Pappina forget
ill usage, little to make her happy. She moved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
close to Guiseppe's side in her impetuous way, and
leaned her head against his arm. He saw the tears
in her eyes. Again taking one of her feet in his
hand, he said with gentleness:</p>

<p>"Marta, think of the miles this child has walked
There's not much sole left, and the leather&mdash;look
at it! Well, what do you think. Marta? Do you
suppose we can find shoes in Amalfi to fit such little
feet?"</p>

<p>"Why, Guiseppe," exclaimed Pappina, "you
don't really mean I shall have another new pair!
I've been so bad, too. You know I've been horrid,
but so have you, Guiseppe, and its only Marta
who's been good, and we&mdash;" She took one of
Guiseppe's hands in hers, kissed it, and began to
cry.</p>

<p>"There, there, <i>bambina</i>, we've both been bad.
We'll start all over again. Don't cry. Here,
Marta, suppose you take her down to the water
again. See, a little way down there the children
are in bathing. You may as well let Pappina go in.
It will do her good and rest her. She doesn't
complain, for she's not the whimpering kind,
but she looks tired out."</p>

<p>Pappina dried her tears and Marta soon had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
her in the bright water. This was the first time
Pappina had ever been in bathing, and at first
she was afraid. Marta quickly calmed her fears,
and her merry laughter reached Guiseppe's ears,
luring him to the shore.</p>

<p>When Pappina was called, much to Marta and
Guiseppe's surprise, there was no teasing to stay
in longer; just a big splash. She came up half
strangling, shook herself, and was out of the water
refreshed and bubbling with happiness. When
dressed, she ran to Guiseppe and seized his two
hands.</p>

<p>"Let's dance, Guiseppe," she cried.</p>

<p>Before he realized it, Pappina was gleefully
whirling him round and round. Guiseppe found
himself quite out of breath from laughter and
dancing. Soon, however, he pantingly released
himself.</p>

<p>"I feel so fine after my bath that I could run
all the way to Amalfi," the child cried, "I'm sure
I could! Guiseppe, because you let me go in the
water, I love you enough to eat you this very
minute. Come, mayn't we go now?"</p>

<p>Guiseppe, lighting his pipe, made playful
answer:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>"There's a little lady I know who made a stiff
old man dance till he was all out of breath, and
now he has to rest a bit before he starts to tramp
again."</p>

<p>Pappina heaved a little sigh as she sat down
by Marta and began to make pictures out of the
white clouds in the bright blue Italian sky.</p>

<p>"Do you see that animal?" she asked, pointing
to the clouds. "There's the head, and over there&mdash;see&mdash;doesn't
that look like the tail? What is
it, Marta?"</p>

<p>Marta studied the cloud a moment before replying:
"It looks more like a crocodile than
anything else."</p>

<p>"Please, Marta, tell me again about that awful
crocodile."</p>

<p>Guiseppe looked questioningly at Marta.</p>

<p>"I was telling her yesterday that we should go
through Maori," she explained. "I went there
years ago with Countess Filota."</p>

<p>"What has that to do with the crocodile?"</p>

<p>"Tell him, Marta," Pappina begged. "He'll
like the story."</p>

<p>"Once upon a time, so the story goes, there
lived an immense crocodile in the cave near Maori.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
It was said and believed that he who dared
kill the crocodile would immediately turn into a
fierce dragon. People preferred to chance being
eaten rather than to kill him at such a risk. He
was said to feed only upon Christians."</p>

<p>"Why didn't he eat the bad people?" asked
the child.</p>

<p>Guiseppe laughed.</p>

<p>"Just as you were going to eat me a few
minutes ago," he said, "because I let you go in
the water! Well, we may as well tramp along.
We've lots of places to go and plenty of rough
roads to travel. No matter where we go, there'll
be people to amuse. The more money we get the
sooner we'll go to America. Come, Marta; come,
Pappina. Where are the puppets? Here's the
whole show now, and all of us are happy&mdash;eh,
<i>bambina?</i>"</p>

<p>Marta hastily tied up the few effects into a
small, neat bundle. Guiseppe picked up the
Punchinellos, while Pappina, as usual, had only
her tambourine.</p>

<p>They sauntered contentedly along up the rising
road, across the bridge over the valley, reaching
Vietri at sunset. There, under one of the beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
terraces that abound on this coast, they remained
over night.</p>

<p>Pappina was the first to awaken. For some
time she took pleasure in watching the many colors
of the water and the boats coming and going.
She saw in the distance a throng of early bathers&mdash;men
and women swimming in the clear bright
bay, or basking on the beach in the early morning
sun. The bright hues of the bathing&ndash;suits first
attracted Pappina's attention. As soon as she
saw the gay colors she wished to go and watch
the bathers.</p>

<p>"I'm going to watch them," she whispered
softly to Marta. "I'll be back soon, Marta."</p>

<p>Marta shook her head.</p>

<p>"You had better not go, <i>carina</i>," she answered.
"Guiseppe may not like it if he awakens and finds
you gone."</p>

<p>"I won't run away," the child persisted.
"Truly, Marta, I'll be back soon. I'm happy
now, Marta; tell Guiseppe so, and that I'll surely
be back in a little while. Perhaps I'll be back
before he wakes up. It's all right for me to go,
isn't it, Marta?"</p>

<p>"Go, but don't stay long, <i>carina</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>Pappina was so accustomed to carry her tambourine
everywhere she went that from force of
habit she took it with her this morning. Her
dress was shabby from hard wear, but her eyes
were gloriously bright as she lifted them to smile
into the faces of the fine ladies and gentlemen
down for their early morning swim.</p>

<p>They noted the abundant life that shone from
her eyes, the unconsciousness of her manner. The
worn frock only added charm to her looks, contrasting
with her loveliness as she stood near the
throng, not daring to approach.</p>

<p>It was her shyness that brought to her the
attention of these foreigners, who had grown accustomed
to being followed by children begging
for money or ready to sing for <i>soldi</i>. A group
on the beach watched her, lost in admiration.</p>

<p>"Have you ever in all your life seen such eyes?"
It was an American lady who spoke. "Talk to
her; see what she is here for. She has her tambourine;
is she a wandering minstrel, do you
think? Or don't they have such things in Italy?"</p>

<p>Pappina little thought they were talking about
her as she stood laughing at the pranks of the
people in the water. She was interested in them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
all&mdash;the dark and the fair; the slight and the stout;
those coming and those going; all seemingly
satisfied with life as they found it in the brilliant
season's height at Vietri.</p>

<p>"There's the sweetest sight I've seen in all
Italy!" exclaimed one of the bathers. "Let's
ask for a song."</p>

<p>Pappina, when she saw one of the gentlemen
approaching her, turned to run, half&ndash;afraid of
the big man in his striped bathing&ndash;suit, but
hearing a lady's voice calling her, she looked back.
She saw that the gentleman was closely followed
by some half&ndash;dozen ladies, so she smilingly and
timidly approached them.</p>

<p>"Will you give us a song?" the gentleman
asked her in English.</p>

<p>Pappina shook her head as she said in her own
tongue:</p>

<p>"I am Italian and I do not understand what
you say."</p>

<p>He struck her tambourine.</p>

<p>"<i>Si, si</i>, signor." Pappina guessed what they
wanted. She sang a song. They begged for
another, so she gave them the little song in English
which Marta had taught her. Her accent amused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a><br /><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
them, and they laughed heartily as they gave
her money.</p><br />

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Amalfi</p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1">"It's mine, all mine!" she cried as she left
the foreigners. "But Guiseppe is so good he
may have it all. I'll put it in my shoe and take
it out piece by piece. He must guess what
each one is. Oh, won't it be fun, and how
glad he'll be!"</p>

<p>She laughed aloud as she hid her money.
Her heart was so light that her joy broke from her
lips in snatches of song as she tripped blithely
back to Marta and Guiseppe.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Guiseppe had awakened in unusual
ill&ndash;humor.</p>

<p>"Marta," he growled, "those confounded
sticks hurt my back all night! Why didn't you
clear them away? You must have seen them.
I notice there are none where your idol slept."</p>

<p>He looked around. "Where is she, anyway?"</p>

<p>"She went, only for a moment, to watch the
bathers."</p>

<p>"Watch the bathers? She has run away:
that's what she has done."</p>

<p>Stopping to tie her shoe, Pappina heard Guiseppe's
gruff voice swearing at Marta. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
standing in front of his wife, so neither could see
the child coming down the road.</p>

<p>Marta's voice, perfectly calm, reached Pappina.</p>

<p>"Too bad she doesn't run away," the woman
said, "but she'll return."</p>

<p>For days Marta had been growing braver, less
fearful of Guiseppe. There was no sign of fright
on her face even when Guiseppe shook his fist
at her.</p>

<p>"You grow a bigger fool every day," he was
saying. "You let her go. When I find her I'll
beat her. If I'm good to her one day she walks
over me the next. I'll beat you both, you fool,
do you hear?"</p>

<p>"<i>Sono qui</i> [I am here], Guiseppe," came faintly
from Pappina's trembling lips. "Don't be cross,
Guiseppe. I didn't think you would care."</p>

<p>Guiseppe turned toward her fiercely; he started
to upbraid her, but there was such an expression
of submissive beauty on her face, that he stopped
and wheeled suddenly about.</p>

<p>"Get along," he muttered. "I'll walk behind
to&ndash;day for a change."</p>

<p>Pappina forgot about the money, even that
she had it, until it hurt her foot as she walked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll never tell," she vowed to herself. "It's
mine, and some day when he's so mean and horrid
that we can't stand him any longer, Marta and I
will run away."</p>

<p>Several times, in a forgiving spirit, Pappina
went back to Guiseppe and walked by his side,
trying to be friendly with him. Her efforts each
time were met with a scowl that sent her again to
Marta, who always gave her a welcoming smile.</p>

<p>Guiseppe grumbled almost constantly to himself.
Marta, fearing trouble, said to Pappina:</p>

<p>"Won't you try once more, <i>carina?</i> It is best
for us all to have no discord."</p>

<p>"I want to be friends with Guiseppe," replied
Pappina.</p>

<p>She waited again for the man. This time she
look hold of his hand and, looking archly into his
face, asked: "Is he going to be cross all day?"</p>

<p>He pulled his hand away.</p>

<p>"Don't you like me this morning?" There
was no reply. "Not a bit, Guiseppe?"</p>

<p>No one but such a bear as Guiseppe was just
then could have resisted this fairy, who smiled
so steadfastly into his face.</p>

<p>"<i>Basta</i>," he said sternly. This rebuff was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
sufficient for Pappina. She took her place by
Marta's side and they walked on in silence,
trudging over four and a half miles to the little
fishing village of Cetara.</p>

<p>On the beach was a group of fishermen, with
their wives and children&mdash;the women busily
mending their fishing&ndash;nets, the men smoking and
chatting; all enjoying life together.</p>

<p>As soon as Guiseppe saw them he hastened
his footsteps, overtook Marta and Pappina, and
was soon far ahead of them, down on the beach
with the fishermen.</p>

<p>When Marta and Pappina reached the group
they stopped and stood hesitating whether or not
to join Guiseppe. There was no sign from him.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he is waiting for you," Marta said
to Pappina.</p>

<p>The child went toward Guiseppe, but as soon
as she reached him he turned from her as though
her presence annoyed him. Thinking to please
him, she began to sing, but he raised his hand and
silenced her.</p>

<p>"Stop!" he growled. "This is the place for the
puppets, not you."</p>

<p>His bad temper showed even in the puppet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
performance. The little he received from the
fishermen did not improve his mood. Without a
word to any one he took up the Punchinellos and,
muttering to himself, walked doggedly, on, passing
without a stop through Majori, Minori and Altrani,
angry at the whole beautiful world.</p>

<p>There were so many things to interest Pappina
that she forgot Guiseppe's unkindness. The
orange trees and lemon plantations were a beautiful
picture that called forth constant exclamations of
admiration and delight.</p>

<p>By&ndash;and&ndash;by, however, the money hurt her foot
so severely that she could not enjoy anything.
She was glad when the long tramp was over and
they were at last at Amalfi.</p>

<p>Guiseppe threw himself down exhausted. Marta
sat down beside him, and Pappina behind both.
She wanted to take off her shoe and she was determined
Guiseppe should not see the money.
Her little foot was blistered from the rubbing of
the coins.</p>

<p>"Oh, what shall I do with them? They hurt
me so! He'll surely see them and take them from
me if I don't put them back in my shoe." So she
replaced them, ate her supper, went to sleep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
and dreamed all night that she was walking on
thistles.</p>

<p>The following morning, Guiseppe did not seem
at all inclined to move on. Neither Marta nor
Pappina cared to speak to him, nor he to them.
Along in the afternoon, the silence began to be
distressing to Pappina.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose he is going to do?"
she asked Marta. "I won't ask him; he's so cross
I won't speak to him."</p>

<p>Marta shook her head.</p>

<p>"We shall just have to wait," she whispered.
"Try to be patient."</p>

<p>Not far away, boys were coming from a large
building, bearing on their heads long boxes or
boards. Pappina watched them for a time;
then she asked Marta what they were doing.</p>

<p>"They are bringing out <i>paste</i> [letter noodles],"
Marta explained. "Do you see how they spread
it out in the sun? That is so it will dry."</p>

<p>"I wish we were nearer, so I could see them
better. May I go?"</p>

<p>"No, <i>carina</i>; I am sure Guiseppe will not let
you, and I&mdash;no, I am sorry, <i>carina</i>, but I dare not
let you go."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I want to go much so, Marta. Won't
you please ask him?"</p>

<p>"It will only make him crosser, <i>carina</i>."</p>

<p>"I dare not ask him, for he will not even look
at me," the child went on. "If you only knew
how much I want to go, you would ask him.
Please, please ask him, Marta!"</p>

<p>Pappina had been losing her courage and
Marta steadily growing braver. When she decided
to grant Pappina's request, she felt quite fearless
of Guiseppe as she went to his side.</p>

<p>"Guiseppe, have you noticed those boys?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't help noticing them, could I?
They've been doing the same thing all day."</p>

<p>"Shall we walk over there and watch them?"</p>

<p>"Watch them! What for?"</p>

<p>By this time, Pappina had found courage to
join Marta, who continued:</p>

<p>"I thought perhaps you would like to go.
Pappina is interested in what they are doing;
would you care if she goes for a while?"</p>

<p>Guiseppe made no reply. "I'll come back,
Guiseppe," Pappina pleaded. "I know I'm bad
and cross, but I have never told you a lie, never
one." There was no reply. "I want so much to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
go. Oh, won't you please let me, Guiseppe?"</p>

<p>Pappina's earnest little face was raised appealingly
toward his, but he did not even glance at
her as he replied:</p>

<p>"Get along. I'll be glad to be rid of you for
an hour. One hour&mdash;no longer&mdash;or there'll be
trouble; do you hear?"</p>

<p>"<i>Si</i>, signor, I'll be back."</p>

<p>Guiseppe's consent was hardly given before she
was off. For some time she watched the boys
bringing out the paste, but it made her hungry.</p>

<p>"I'm starved," she said to herself. "I will
spend one of my <i>soldi</i> for macaroni."</p>

<p>After she had eaten the macaroni she decided
that she had much time to see the town in the hour
Guiseppe had allowed her.</p>

<p>She came to St. Andrew's Cathedral.</p>

<p>"Maybe if I pray, Guiseppe will stop being so
cross. Maybe I'm cross, too," she said to herself
as she ran up the long flight of stairs leading to
the entrance.</p>

<p>Children were playing in the church. An
American lady gave them <i>soldi</i> to say prayers for
her son. There were ladies near Pappina who
were speaking in her own tongue. She heard them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
say they were going to visit St. Andrew's tomb.
Pappina followed them.</p>

<p>At the tomb she knelt, and, bowing her head,
began to say her prayers. As she prayed her
tired eyelids gradually closed; she lost herself.
Starting up, she remembered she was in church,
praying; so she began again, "Santa Maria."
The little head drooped. She opened her eyes.
"S&ndash;a&ndash;n&ndash;t&ndash;a M&ndash;a&ndash;r&ndash;i&ndash;a&mdash;" The weary child had
knelt, prayed, and fallen asleep, beside the tomb
of St. Andrew.</p>

<p>It was late at night that the sexton, going his
rounds, was startled to see what appeared to be a
bundle of something red lying by the tomb.
Throwing the full rays of the lantern upon the
object, he discovered that it was a little child.
Many times before he had found children sleeping
in the church, but never one by this sacred tomb.</p>

<p>"<i>Poverina!</i>" he exclaimed, awakening her as
gently as possible. "<i>Poverina</i>, you cannot sleep
here. I am sorry, but it is against the rules.
You must run home. Come." He took her by
the arm, led her to the door and put her out in
the darkness.</p>

<p>Pappina, scarcely awake, was dazed when left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
alone. She heard the door close, heard the key
turn. For a moment she could not think where
she was, or what had happened. She only knew
that it was very dark, that she was alone and afraid.
She pounded on the church door.</p><br />

</div></div>

<p class="p1">"Let me in, let me in," she begged. "I'm
afraid."</p>

<p>No one came to her call; she peered up and
down the street. There was no one in sight.</p>

<p>"I shall lose my way if I try to go back alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
in the dark," she thought. Then she crouched
down on the church steps and cried herself to
sleep.</p>

<p>Early next morning, Guiseppe and Marta
started to search for Pappina. As they neared St.
Andrew's Cathedral Marta spied something red at
the top of the steps.</p>

<p>"Wait, Guiseppe! I think&mdash;" she left the
sentence unfinished as she dashed up the steps and
snatched Pappina in her arms, uttering tender,
loving words. Guiseppe followed, with scowls and
mutterings.</p>

<p>Pappina, being thus awakened, threw her
arms about Marta's neck, and cried from sheer joy
at finding herself safe.</p>

<p>"Oh, oh, I was lost, and so frightened I dared
not move! I meant to come back in an hour,
Guiseppe, truly I did, but it was dark, and I could
not find my way."</p>

<p>The sexton, hearing voices, opened the door.</p>

<p>"I found your little girl last night," he said.
"You see, she was sleeping by the sacred tomb
of St.&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Diavolo!</i>" interrupted Guiseppe harshly.
"Why didn't you kick her down the steps?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>"Guiseppe, for shame! The poor little dear!"
Marta cried, as she hugged Pappina close to her.</p>

<p>"Don't be hard on the child," begged the sexton.
"She was tired and sleepy. I'd have let
her sleep inside, but it's against the rules, so I had
to put her out. <i>Poverina</i>," he said, laying his
hand on Pappina's head.</p>

<p>"<i>Poverina!</i> Bah! Put her down, Marta."
Guiseppe took Pappina roughly by the arm as he
continued: "I'm sick of your behavior. You
must understand you are bound to me&mdash;to me.
I paid money for you, and what do I get? Trouble,
trouble, nothing else."</p>

<p>"I know it, Guiseppe. I'm sorry, but this
time I couldn't help it."</p><br />

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="pn center slarge"><span class="smcap">Sorrento, Where Hardships End</span></p>

<p class="p1">"Fifteen miles to Sorrento. As near as I can
find out, there'll be no money for us along the way,"
Guiseppe muttered as they left St. Andrew's
Cathedral.</p>

<p>"There's Positano," said Marta, "and the
villas. You have passed so many and stopped
at none."</p>

<p>Guiseppe looked surprised.</p>

<p>"So I have, fool that I am! Why didn't you
speak of it before?"</p>

<p>Marta made no reply and the three walked on
in silence. Guiseppe evidently was brooding over
the money he had missed, for after some half
hour's tramp he turned to Marta.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you speak?" he growled. "Lords
and ladies in the villas we have passed, and no
money for me! Do you think we've done so well
we can afford to lose a chance? Marta, you seem
to have a way of keeping your mouth shut when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
you should open it, but you have been free enough
with your tongue lately when you should have
held it."</p>

<p>Guiseppe was growing almost unbearable. He
grumbled at everybody and everything.</p>

<p>When they met women carrying wood to town,
wine&ndash;venders and occasionally foreigners, he received
their greetings with a scowl. Once or
twice tourists had tossed Pappina a few <i>soldi</i>, but
no one wanted the Punchinellos.</p>

<p>The three visited a few villas, going up the
alley, as it would be called in America, by the side
of the house. The Punchinellos played, and
Pappina sang and was paid and fed, but nothing
satisfied Guiseppe. He grumbled continually.
The harvest made on fete days had spoiled him
for small gains.</p>

<p>"I'm sick of picking up meals wherever we
can find them, and of sleeping on the hard ground,"
he said repeatedly to Marta, as though it were her
fault that he was enduring discomforts. Guiseppe
had been too many years in his home not to miss it.
"Some people may like to tramp all over the country
and pick up a living like dogs in an alley, but
I'm sick of it, I tell you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>It was first Marta, then Pappina who was
made to feel his ill&ndash;humor. Neither cared to speak
either to him or each other as hand in hand they
followed Guiseppe. Once in a while he would
turn to look behind, with ugly words to one or
both.</p>

<p>They made few stops. When told to sing,
Pappina made every effort to please Guiseppe, but
no matter how well she sang and danced he found
fault with her.</p>

<p>They were two days on the road from Amalfi
to Sorrento; Guiseppe never once softened toward
either Marta or Pappina. It was not to be
expected that his wife should resent his treatment,
for she was used to it; but Marta was in constant
fear that Pappina would lose her temper and there
would be trouble. The poor woman was relieved
each night when the two were asleep and there had
been no outbreak from the child.</p>

<p>Nothing on the road interested Pappina; the
luxuriant lemon and orange groves were passed
unnoticed as she trudged, worn and footsore,
along the hot, dusty road between the high garden
walls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>As they neared Sorrento, Marta tried to interest
the child.</p>

<p>"Look, <i>carina</i>," she said, "these deep places
are called ravines. Years ago when people
believed in fairies, they used to say dwarfs lived
all about Sorrento in these deep ravines that
enclose it."</p>

<p>Pappina made no reply. She seemed tired of
everything except Marta. She held her good
friend's hand tight and drew closer to her every
time Guiseppe turned to look at them.</p>

<p>As soon as the town was reached Guiseppe
began his growling anew.</p>

<p>"Sorrento! So this is the town old Genaro
talks about. Crowing over me! Seems to think
he knows such a lot. Bah! Tasso! Tasso&mdash;bah,
I say!"</p>

<p>"Is that where I am to sing, Guiseppe?" Pappina
asked timidly as she shook the dust from her
frayed little frock.</p>

<p>"I'm not talking to you. You had better
learn to mind you own business. Marta, I'll
not leave this town till I see where the sister
of that man Tasso lived, and I'll see his
statue, too."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tasso." Marta spoke the name softly, not
daring to question.</p>

<p>"Yes, Tasso. You don't know anything about
him, and you don't need to know. If old Genaro
thinks we haven't seen scenery since we've been
traveling around the country, he's fooled."</p>

<p>Pappina looked shyly into Guiseppe's set,
hard face. Her curiosity was aroused and she
wanted to know about Tasso.</p>

<p>"Signor Genaro might ask me about Tasso,"
she suggested, "and I don't know anything about
him, do I?"</p>

<p>Guiseppe looked at Pappina for a moment
as though it were on his lips to rebuke her, turned
on his heel and started to walk away, then came
back.</p>

<p>"You're right for once, girl," he said, grudgingly.
"Genaro might ask you, and I want you
both to let him see you know about Tasso. It
won't hurt either of you to learn something.
Tasso was a famous poet. Well, let me see&mdash;what
was it old Genaro told me? Oh, yes;
I remember. He was very wild and ran away
from home. The house where he was born and
the rock on which it stood were swallowed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
sea, but his sister's house is here and the thing to
do is to see that and to go to the Piazza and see
his statue."</p>

<p>"Now I remember," said Marta. "I went
with the countess. She told me that he came
back to his sister's house disguised as a shepherd,
and that is why her home is of interest to
tourists."</p>

<p>"Bah! What do they care&mdash;what do I care&mdash;about
a poet who has been dead over three hundred
years? I'll go&mdash;I'll go. I'll give old Genaro to
understand that I saw everything worth seeing.
Marta, keep your eye on the upstart, or she'll
be going too. Mind what I tell you."</p>

<p>He mopped his brow, handed the Punchinellos
to Marta, and was off. Pappina heaved a sigh of
relief as she watched him go down the street.
When he was quite out of sight, she took off her
shoe and showed Marta the money she had hidden
away. There were two francs and small coins in
plenty.</p>

<p>"Don't tell Guiseppe; will you, Marta? It's
for you and me to run away with to America when
Guiseppe gets too bad. Take it, Marta, and keep
it for us."</p><br />

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center"> Tarantella dancers</p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1">The tears came to Marta's eyes and her voice
shook as she replied:</p>

<p>"No, no, it's yours, <i>bambina</i>. Hide it back
in your shoe. Marta likes to know her little one
has money snugged away where she can use it if
she needs it."</p>

<p>Guiseppe soon returned in the same bad humor
in which he had been all the way to Sorrento.</p>

<p>"Those Americans have sent for the Tarantella
dancers to come to the Vittoria Hotel to&ndash;night to
dance the Tarantella for them. They say they
dance it better here than in Naples. We will take
the upstart there and see what she is worth. Fix
her up. There'll be a crowd."</p>

<p>He looked at Pappina. Her face was drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
and white, her hair disordered, her frock soiled,
wrinkled and torn.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with the girl?" he asked.
"She looks like a hungry beggar. See her shoes,
her dress all dirt and stains. Confound you,
Pappina, where's your beauty gone? You are
all eyes to&ndash;day, when you ought to look like something."
He grabbed her fiercely by the
arm and shook her. Pappina's hot Italian blood
boiled.</p>

<p>"You coward!" she hissed the words. She
doubled up her little fist and raised it to strike him.
Guiseppe grabbed her hand and shook her again
in his fury. Marta sprang to Pappina's rescue
with a savage look on her face no one had ever
seen there before. Guiseppe loosened his hold on
Pappina and pushed her away from him with such
force she would have fallen to the ground had not
Marta caught her.</p>

<p>"Coward! Fiend! Coward!" the child hissed
through her set teeth.</p>

<p>"Coward, eh! Call me names, will you?
We'll see after to&ndash;night. Marta, wash her impudent
face; comb her hair; for heaven's sake do
something! They'll think she is no more than a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
beggar, and they are sick of beggars. We found
that out at Amalfi, where the whole town begs."</p>

<p>Marta washed Pappina, combed her hair, and
tried to smooth out her dress and make her acceptable
to Guiseppe; but he seemed determined not
to be pleased.</p>

<p>"Can't you keep your eyelids down a little?"
he said to the child. "I tell you, you are all eyes
to&ndash;day&mdash;great big, black, staring eyes! Pinch
up her cheeks, Marta; see if you can't get some
color in them."</p>

<p>Pappina looked pleadingly first at Marta then
at Guiseppe, then burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Stop your crying, you wild&ndash;eyed beggar!
Lost your spirit, too? What are you good for,
I'd like to know, with beauty and spirit both
gone!"</p>

<p>Pappina dried her tears and choked back her
sobs, while Marta stood as if paralyzed. She
longed to soothe the child, yet dared not, her old
fear of Guiseppe upon her again.</p>

<p>"There'll be great dancing at the Vittoria to&ndash;night.
Get up and show me what you can do. You
needn't sing; I want to see your dancing."</p>

<p>Pappina did not move.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you deaf, too? Didn't you hear me?
I say dance!"</p>

<p>"Guiseppe," came faintly from the frightened
child, "I will try to please you to&ndash;night, but I
cannot dance now. Be good to me; then I shall
be happy and dance all night if you wish me to."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's your own way you want again, is it?
For once I want mine and I'll have it, too. Dance
now&mdash;at once!"</p>

<p>"I'll try."</p>

<p>She tried. Her body was quivering from
excitement and fear. Her little blistered foot
pained her. She couldn't dance. Guiseppe
watched her angrily, Marta tearfully, as she lifted
her tambourine, struck it and danced one step&mdash;two&mdash;then
dropped on her knees.</p>

<p>"<i>Pieta, pieta</i> [pity, pity], signor," she cried.
"I cannot dance now. To&ndash;night&mdash;with the music,
the people and the dancers&mdash;I will dance well then;
not now, Guiseppe. I pray you, dear Marta, tell
him I cannot."</p>

<p>Guiseppe took up a big stick that was lying
near him. He struck Pappina once&mdash;twice. She
was on her feet like a flash. She started to run,
Guiseppe seized her by her dress; it slipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
through his fingers and before he had time to collect
himself she was gone, speeding like a deer down the
street. She was running away from Guiseppe, she
neither knew nor cared where.</p>

<p>Down the street, turning one corner after
another, on, on to the <i>marina</i>, where she was soon
lost in the throng of boys and tourists. She
jumped into a row&ndash;boat just as the oarsman was
starting with his load of passengers for the steamer
leaving Sorrento for Naples.</p>

<p>There were a few moments of suspense; then
she was hurried aboard the steamer with the others.
She was safe!</p>

<p>Guiseppe, as he sprang after Pappina, stumbled
on his own cruel stick. When he got to his feet the
child was turning a corner. He saw the little red
dress and its owner disappear from his view
forever. He glared in a frenzy at Marta.</p>

<p>"Curse her! Curse her!" he shrieked. "To&ndash;day
of all days to get away from me! Marta,
have you turned to stone? Why don't you move?
Why didn't you run after her, instead of standing
there staring like a mummy? We must have her
before dark. Go&mdash;search everywhere. Move!&mdash;Don't
stop till you find her."</p><br />

<p class="pn center slarge"><span class="smcap">Naples, and a New Life</span></p>

<p class="pn p2">Pappina stood on the deck, holding fast to the
railing for support. Her face was livid, her body
shook. She looked anxiously toward the shore to
see if she had been followed. There were no
signs of Guiseppe!</p>

<p>She kept her eyes riveted on the boys splashing
in the water until they appeared mere specks in
the distance. Then, worn out with excitement,
she sank down and burst into tears. Stifling her
sobs, presently the child fell asleep from sheer
exhaustion.</p>

<p>The captain, passing that way, saw Pappina
curled up on the deck. He could not see her
winsome, beautiful face, for it was buried in her
arms as she lay there sleeping. He saw just a
child with a tattered, dirty dress and ragged little
shoes. He gave her a kick.</p>

<p>"Get up," he said. "What are you doing
here? This is no place for beggars; move on."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>Pappina jumped up quickly. He had called
her a beggar. She looked at him with flashing
eyes.</p>

<p>"Beggar!" cried she. "No, signor, I'm not a
beggar. You want money? I have it, I can pay."
She began to unfasten one of her little worn shoes.
The captain stood watching her, perplexed.</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" he asked himself.
"She has such beauty and pride, and her clothes
are so poor! She is alone and has money in her
shoe. I am puzzled this time, for sure."</p>

<p>He tugged fiercely at his long black mustache,
waiting to see what she would offer him from
her store. She brought up coins and handed him
a franc.</p>

<p>"Is that enough, signor?" she asked. "I
have more."</p>

<p>Looking into the unfathomable depths of those
great velvet eyes, the captain would have refused
the wealth of Cr&oelig;sus had she offered it. Her
beauty and her independence conquered him.</p>

<p>"Keep your money, child. As long as I run
the boat you ride free."</p>

<p>"<i>Grazie, buono signor</i> [Thanks, good sir].
May I go inside? The boat rocks so. I feel&mdash;may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
I lie down just a little while, signor? I have
my tambourine and I can sing and dance for you
by&ndash;and&ndash;by when my head&mdash;when I am not so
dizzy."</p>

<p>"Go inside, child, and lie down. I will look
after you soon."</p>

<p>Pappina, catching hold of chairs and benches to
steady herself, staggered inside and lay down,
dizzy and faint. She was too sick even to think
or to wonder where the boat was taking her.</p>

<p>The steamer was filled with people returning
from Capri and the wonderful Blue Grotto.
Among the tourists was Mrs. Elinor Thurston, a
childless American widow traveling abroad with
friends, seeking some new interest from day to
day&mdash;anything to make her forget the loss of her
husband and her only child. She noticed Pappina's
pale, beautiful face and her glorious eyes.
There was something about the child that reminded
Mrs. Thurston of her boy. She watched Pappina
intently as the little girl threw herself on the
floor. The forlorn figure interested her, lying
with her tambourine tightly clasped in her hands.</p>

<p>"Poor child!" she murmured softly.</p>

<p>"Such a picture!" exclaimed one of the tourists.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
"I must take a snap&ndash;shot of this typical
little Italian beauty."</p>

<p>Pappina, hearing voices near her, opened her
eyes. Her glance fell upon the sweet face of Mrs.
Thurston, who sat looking kindly at her. The
child smiled faintly, closed her eyes again, and was
asleep.</p>

<p>That smile won Mrs. Thurston. She watched
to see who was with the little girl, and seeing no
one she inquired of the captain:</p>

<p>"Tell me, who is with that beautiful child?"
Her face was diffused with tender, earnest solicitude
as she gazed at the little figure lying at their
feet.</p>

<p>"No one, apparently; she seems to be alone."</p>

<p>The captain then related to Mrs. Thurston how
the little girl had taken money from her shoe
and offered it to him for her fare.</p>

<p>Pappina began to talk in her sleep.</p>

<p>"He struck me," she murmured. "It hurt
me so!" They tried to make out her words, so
jumbled at first, then clearer and louder, till she
fairly screamed: "Guiseppe, how dare you strike
me? Marta, hold him. I hate him! I wish he
were dead&mdash;I do, for I hate him!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Thurston stooped and took hold of the
child's hot little hand.</p>

<p>"See how flushed her face is!" she whispered.
"Her pulse is too quick; she is feverish, poor
child," she said with pity as she gently picked
her up and placed her on a sofa.</p>

<p>"She is my charge and I'll stay with her," she
told the friends who urged her to go on deck and
enjoy the beautiful scenery.</p>

<p>"Scenery!" she exclaimed as she took Pappina's
hand in hers. "There is nothing so beautiful as
this child. I am almost hoping no one will claim
her when we land at Naples, for I need her. Her
eyes are like my Harold's, so&mdash;" She could not
finish the sentence for the tears that welled to her
eyes and the sorrow that choked her.</p>

<p>At Naples no one came for Pappina, alone and
sick, still tossing her head in pain and fever.</p>

<p>"I cannot leave her," her new friend declared.
"She must be cared for. Oh, how glad I am that
I can do everything for her!"</p>

<p>Pappina, still unconscious, was carried to a
carriage and taken to the International Hospital.</p>

<p>"See that every attention is given her," Mrs.
Thurston said. "Leave nothing undone. Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
is my card, and I am responsible for her. I will
be back in the morning."</p>

<p>It was hard for Mrs. Thurston to leave Pappina,
but friends were waiting for her and there was an
engagement to fulfill.</p>

<p>The nurse put Pappina to bed, dressed in a
little white nightgown, the first she had ever worn.</p>

<p>Early the following day Mrs. Thurston called.</p>

<p>"How is she?" she inquired eagerly. "Still
unconscious? Take me to her. All night I have
thought and dreamed of her. Her eyes have
haunted me even in my sleep. Take me to her."</p>

<p>She asked anxiously if any one had sought
the child.</p>

<p>"No one? Oh, joy! Perhaps I may have her
for my own."</p>

<p>Enrichetta, the nurse, showed the welts on the
child's body&mdash;two red marks from Guiseppe's
stick.</p>

<p>"<i>Povera figlietta</i> [Poor little girl]," she said.
"It is now quite certain she will have a run of
fever."</p>

<p>The excitement and strain of the past few weeks
had proved too much for Pappina. In her delirium
it was always of Guiseppe she spoke. She would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
beg, plead and defy him, start to sing, then cry:
"The tambourine will make no music. It is
broken. I cannot sing or dance now, Guiseppe,
for my head hurts and the sun is so hot."</p>

<p>It was easy to gather from her delirious talk
some idea of the hard life she had led.</p>

<p>No artist's dream could have appeared more
beautiful than she, as she lay in her bed. Mrs.
Thurston came every day, sometimes twice, to
see her. In Pappina she had found a real interest
in life; and her motherly heart warmed toward
this lovely, abused child.</p>

<p>True love for Pappina sprang up in her heart
in the days of the child's convalescence. In the
long talks the two had together there was never
a word of complaint against Guiseppe. The
physician and nurse in charge with Mrs. Thurston
questioned her and she willingly told them all,
but never with complaints.</p>

<p>"I think I was as bad as I could be, because,
you see, Guiseppe paid money for me, and sometimes
when I was tired I did not want to sing and
dance. Oh, please don't make me go back
to him!"</p>

<p>"I will find Guiseppe," declared Mrs. Thurston.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
"I will pay him back with interest all he paid for
you, and you may be my little girl if you will."</p>

<p>"Your little girl! I the little girl of such a
lady!" The bright look on the child's face changed
as she continued:</p>

<p>"You haven't seen my clothes. The red dress
was splendid before I spoiled it and my shoes were
new once."</p>

<p>"Never mind the clothes. New clothes go
with your new life, dear."</p>

<p>All the time Pappina was recovering, Mrs.
Thurston was having search made for Guiseppe.
Two days before Pappina left the hospital, he
was found on the Toledo with his Punchinellos.
Those employed to find him were looking for a
Punchinello showman with a brown&ndash;haired, pale&ndash;faced
English wife. All about Naples they
searched, but in vain.</p>

<p>Finding, one day, a man who exactly answered
the description given of Guiseppe, the detective
stopped, watched his show a while, then accosted
him.</p>

<p>"I seek," he said, "for Guiseppe Capasso."</p>

<p>"I am he," replied Guiseppe.</p>

<p>"I have passed you many times," continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
the detective. "I sought a man with a wife, an
Englishwoman who passes the hat."</p>

<p>"<i>Ohime</i> [Ah, me]!" exclaimed Guiseppe. "I
had a wife, but she is no more. A sudden illness
took her from me. Poor Marta!" Guiseppe
bowed his head in sorrow.</p>

<p>"I came to speak of the child."</p>

<p>"Pappina!" cried Guiseppe. "Where is she?
Poor Marta, <i>sposa mia</i> [my wife]&mdash;she died with
Pappina's name on her lips." Guiseppe sobbed in
sincere grief.</p>

<p>For a time he seemed to forget everything but
the loss of his patient, long&ndash;suffering wife. Gradually
it was made known to him that there was
money awaiting him if he would give up all claim
to Pappina. Guiseppe never paid for Pappina
what Mrs. Thurston paid Guiseppe. She wanted
Pappina and money was no object to her.</p>

<p>They thought best not to speak to Pappina of
her home, but let her forget about it as soon as
possible. Pietro was proud to give his child to
so grand a lady, who would educate and do for
her as her very own. So it came about that
Mrs. Elinor Thurston adopted Pappina Pierno.</p>

<p>Nothing could have been sweeter than Pappina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
when she was dressed for the first time after her
illness. Those who were with her laughed and
cried to see her fondle her clothes. Such wonderful
underwear, so sheer and dainty, with ribbon
and lace! Her delight was almost pathetic. If
Mrs. Thurston was hungry for affection she certainly
found all she desired in Pappina, with her
impulsive, appreciative nature.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thurston seemed to live only in and for
the child. Such shopping days as they had!
Such a trunk full of clothes as they bought&mdash;dresses,
hats, coats, gloves, handkerchiefs&mdash;and
perfume too, if you please!</p>

<p>They were a month in Naples and Switzerland;
then Mrs. Thurston decided she would go home,
back to America to have Pappina learn English
and begin her education.</p>

<p>"I'm really going to America to live, and not
just to run away from Guiseppe? Sometimes,
mamma," shyly she said to Mrs. Thurston, "I
think I must be dreaming, but if I am, I never
want to awaken."</p>

<p>"We will keep your tambourine for our
souvenir, <i>carissima</i>, and when you think you are
only dreaming, just strike your tambourine."</p>
